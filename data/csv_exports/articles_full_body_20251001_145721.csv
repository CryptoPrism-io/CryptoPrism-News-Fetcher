52511128,"XRP Futures See Institutional Adoption, Solana Futures Hit $1B OI in 5 Months, Outpacing Bitcoin and Ether: CME Group","Institutional investors are increasingly adopting CME's futures for XRP and solana, the exchange's global head of equity and FX products said. ",Omkar Godbole,1759305964,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/01/xrp-futures-see-institutional-adoption-solana-futures-hit-usd1b-oi-in-5-months-outpacing-bitcoin-and-ether-cme-group,POSITIVE,CoinDesk,"CRYPTOCURRENCY, SOL, XRP, BTC, MARKET",Markets|Markets|News,"SINGAPORE – Institutional investors are quickly embracing CME’s futures for XRP (XRP) and solana (SOL), both launched earlier this year, alongside steady growth in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) derivatives, according to Tim McCourt, the exchange’s Global Head of Equity & FX Products. Speaking at the ongoing Token2049 conference attended by CoinDesk, McCourt stated that total crypto futures open interest, a key indicator of institutional activity, has doubled year-over-year, now reaching $30 to $35 billion daily. Importantly, this growth isn’t driven solely by bitcoin. CME’s cash-settled futures have long served as a go-to for institutions wanting exposure to cryptocurrencies through regulated products, without having to own the tokens directly. Futures contracts are standardized, legally binding agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a specific future date. Open interest refers to the number of active contracts at any one time, often expressed in dollar value. ""When we look at the new futures that we recently introduced this year, XRP and SOL, they are also enjoying institutional adoption, with open interest at record highs,"" McCourt said during the panel "", Institutional Flows Into Digital Assets."" SOL and XRP surge to $1B OI mark The standard solana futures contract, sized at 500 SOL, debuted in mid-March and crossed the $1 billion notional open interest mark in August. Futures tied to the payments-focused XRP crossed that threshold in August, just three months after they began trading with a standard contract size of 50,000 XRP. ""The speed at which solana is accumulating open interest is really interesting. SOL took about five months to hit the one billion [OI] mark, compared to ether, which took about eight months. Meanwhile, BTC took three years,"" McCourt said. He also took note of the record activity in both ether futures and options. As of Tuesday, open interest in ether futures contract, sized at 50 ETH, stood at $9.05 billion, having hit a lifetime peak of $10.42 billion in August. Ether futures began trading on the CME in early 2021. Open interest in ether options also hit a record high of over $1 billion in September. ""While crypto is hot, certainly ether is hot at the CME. We see record open interest, record trading volume, both in standard and micro size contracts,"" McCourt noted. CME futures contribute to price discovery The availability of regulated crypto futures, along with the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S., has brought greater legitimacy and transparency to the market, attracting more institutional capital and increasing overall market liquidity. CME's cash-settled futures enable large investors to hedge risks, speculate, and establish arbitrage plays, effectively managing their net exposure. These futures, therefore, contribute to price discovery, reduce volatility through an orderly trading mechanism, and pave the way for the broader adoption of digital assets within traditional markets. Stablecoins as partners of traditional banks The panel also included a discussion on the impact of ETFs and stablecoins, featuring insights from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Bitwise Asset Management CEO Hunter Horsley, and Heath Tarbert, president of Circle, the issuer of USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin. Tarbert said that stablecoins are ideal partners for traditional banks, emphasizing the importance of legal and regulatory clarity. He added that stablecoins like USDC can help banks integrate and offer tokenized versions of their lending products, stressing that these dollar-pegged tokens are not competitors to banks but pathways to create new financial products. Horsley said that 2025 marks the beginning of the mainstream era for crypto while Teng highlighted different waves of institutional interest."
52509280,Traders Eye September Jobs Report for Cues on Bitcoin Breakout Above $120K,"The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday.",Shaurya Malwa,1759303505,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/01/traders-eye-september-jobs-report-for-cues-on-bitcoin-breakout-above-usd120k,NEUTRAL,CoinDesk,"MACROECONOMICS, CRYPTOCURRENCY, BTC, MARKET, TRADING",Markets|Bitcoin|Trading|Markets|News,"Crypto markets remained unchanged Monday and Tuesday after last week’s $1.5 billion liquidation flush, but traders remain cautious ahead of a critical run of U.S. economic data that could set the tone for October. Bitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out. Total market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound. The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET). “The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk. “This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said. Jobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing. That usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added. Market structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations. “The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.” Kuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.” “On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted. Ethereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review. News around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months. Regulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves. Elsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability."

The BTC Alpha Fund, developed in partnership with Athens-based Starboard Digital, uses arbitrage strategies to target net annual returns of 8%-10%, which are paid directly in Bitcoin. The fund is domiciled in the Cayman Islands and caters to professional and institutional investors. By converting arbitrage gains into bitcoin, participants can increase the number of coins they hold while still benefiting from bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation. Sygnum said the product has already drawn strong interest from clients looking for institutional-grade yield options in digital assets. The fund comes as institutional investors are looking to go beyond just holding bitcoin in their portfolio and use decentralized finance (DeFi) to generate more income from their BTC holdings. The bitcoin DeFi has gained popularity and has the potential to open up a massive market, according to analysts. Recently, Binance research noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, implying a potential for a large ""untapped opportunity."" In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion . ""Bitcoin has become a key exposure in modern portfolios, and many of our clients want to stay invested while building their positions further,"" said Markus Hämmerli, who is leading the BTC Alpha Fund offering at Sygnum. Bitcoin liquidity For investors, one practical feature is that shares in the new fund can be pledged as collateral for U.S. dollar Lombard loans at Sygnum. This setup allows long-term bitcoin holders to unlock liquidity for other investments without selling down their crypto exposure. Monthly liquidity and a strict risk management framework are intended to give the fund flexibility while addressing volatility in digital markets. The partnership also leverages Starboard Digital’s background in trading and risk management. Sygnum has been expanding its bitcoin offerings since launching various initiatives last year. The new fund adds to its growing suite of regulated products aimed at bridging traditional finance and the crypto economy."
52487714,"Bitcoin Steady, but Bitfinex Warns of Downside Risks as U.S. Government Shutdown Looms","Most altcoins including ETH, SOL, AVAX, UNI posted declines Tuesday but bitcoin was flat after a late rally.","Krisztian Sandor,Nikhilesh De",1759261911,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/30/bitcoin-steady-but-bitfinex-warns-of-downside-risks-as-government-shutdown-looms,NEGATIVE,CoinDesk,"CRYPTOCURRENCY, EXCHANGE, MACROECONOMICS, MARKET, BTC",Markets|market analysis|Bitcoin|Shutdown|Bitfinex|News,"The bounce in crypto markets mostly stalled on Tuesday with the U.S. government on track to shut down at midnight Eastern time. Bitcoin (BTC) — after earlier having slid about 2% from overnight highs near $115,000 - managed a late afternoon rally to $114,300, up marginally from 24 hours ago. Ether (ETH) traded just above $4,100, sliding 1.3% during the same period. Most tokens in the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index posted declines, with Avalanche (AVAX), Uniswap (UNI) and Near (NEAR) leading losses. A check on traditional markets showed gold climbing another 0.5% to $3,850, extending its record-breaking run, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 equity indexes also saw late rallies to move into positive territory just minutes ahead of the close. Most market participants are in wait-and-see mode as the U.S. government seems headed toward a certain shutdown of uncertain length. When the government shuts down, all non-essential activities under the executive branch will halt, which will likely include any of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and federal bank regulators' ongoing efforts to create new rules for the crypto industry. While the shutdown won't have an effect on people's ability to file comments for open rulemaking efforts, it's unlikely anyone at these agencies will be tasked to read the feedback. This halt may also affect ongoing efforts by companies to list and trade exchange-traded funds tied to cryptocurrencies like solana (SOL) and litecoin (LTC), CoinDesk reported earlier Tuesday. Congress' work on crypto market structure legislation will be delayed . The Senate Banking Committee already postponed a tentatively planned markup — a hearing to debate provisions on the bill — on its market structure draft from Tuesday to later in October. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not published any draft legislation. The Senate Finance Committee, however, still intends to hold a hearing on Wednesday to examine crypto tax issues . Shutdown leaves BTC fragile, Bitfinex warns A shutdown would also halt the release of key economic indicators such as jobs data and CPI inflation reports that could amplify volatility across asset classes, including cryptos, Bitfinex analysts warned in a report. Data delays could complicate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions with ripple effects echoing across rates markets, the report noted. Global investors have already been cutting U.S. exposure, a trend which a protracted shutdown could accelerate, the report said. ""For markets, the immediate risk is confidence erosion and data blind spots, rather than systemic financial instability,"" Bitfinex analysts said about the potential shutdown. Zooming out, BTC is still in a corrective phase since the Fed's interest rate cut in September, which turned out to be a ""buy the rumor, sell the news event,"" Bitfinex analysts said. The report noted that unlike previous cycles, this one has unfolded in three distinct multi-month surges, each capped by widespread profit-taking. ""At every cyclical peak, more than 90 percent of coins moved were transacted in profit, a clear signal of widespread distribution,"" the analysts wrote. Having just stepped back from the third such peak, Bitfinex analysts see probabilities tilting toward further consolidation. ""Deep political polarisation, rising fiscal deficits and a fragile global economy leave markets more sensitive to shocks,"" they added."

The exchange currently offers retail customers in the U.S. the ability to borrow cash against bitcoin (BTC) holdings through the on-chain Morpho platform. A spokesperson said the average loan size sits at $54,000 but noted the firm plans to raise its borrowing cap from $1 million to $5 million in the coming weeks. “We do see some users borrowing up against the current $1 [million] loan limit, and are excited to meet their needs, as well,” the spokesperson said. “We work closely with the Morpho team to ensure that we maintain steady liquidity in the onchain loan protocol as we roll out to more customers with larger loans.” The product caters to customers looking to access cash without selling their bitcoin, a use case that mirrors how homeowners tap equity or how businesses leverage equipment. Coinbase said top applications include debt consolidation, covering large unexpected expenses such as medical bills or taxes, investing in real estate, and making high-cost purchases. The move comes as the asset-based lending industry continues to expand. A July report projected the market could reach $1.3 trillion by 2030, reflecting broader interest in loans secured by assets beyond traditional real estate or vehicles. By pushing the ceiling higher, Coinbase is positioning itself to serve wealthier clients and investors who may want to borrow against larger bitcoin holdings. The milestone highlights the steady integration of crypto into conventional financial practices."

Blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence shows that the address tagged as ""Tether: Bitcoin Reserves"" received 8,889 BTC from a wallet of Bitfinex, the crypto exchange closely associated with Tether. The address currently holds $9.7 billion in BTC based on the current price of about $113,000, per Arkham. The latest maneuver fits into a pattern of Tether accumulating the largest cryptocurrency, alongside with gold, adding to its BTC stash at the end of quarters. Similar transactions happened at the end of March, December and last September, Arkham data shows. In June, the firm seeded more than 1.4 billion in BTC to Twenty One Capital (XXI), the bitcoin treasury firm led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers with Tether being a lead investor, blockchain data showed, with Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissing rumors of selling BTC for gold. Tether reported $8.9 billion in BTC reserves as of the end of June, according to its second-quarter attestation , with the next report expected in late October with its updated BTC holdings. In the meantime, Tether's USDT token has swelled to a $174.6 billion supply, up 10.7% through the last quarter, CoinGecko data shows, continuing to dominate among the red-hot stablecoin sector. The firm, which previously focused its efforts to serve emerging markets where U.S. dollar access is limited, formally entered the U.S. domestic market by establishing a local branch led by former White House crypto advisor Bo Hines and developing a separate stablecoin dubbed USAT under federal regulatory guidelines.

""BOB Gateway"" connects native Bitcoin to LayerZero’s “omnichain fungible token” (OFT) version of wrapped BTC, an asset issued by BitGo. The integration extends to 11 blockchains including Ethereum, Avalanche and Base, bringing access to nearly 15,000 decentralized apps that can now support direct Bitcoin deposits. Until now, most of these blockchains lacked a straightforward way to connect to Bitcoin. Users often had to navigate complex bridging processes, which carried both technical friction and security risks. With BOB Gateway, they can move between native BTC and wBTC.OFT in one step, a change that could make strategies such as yield farming or looping trades more accessible to retail and institutional investors alike. Yield farming and looping supply liquidity to DeFi platforms, acting as the foundation for lending, borrowing, and trading. This process allows users to earn significant passive income. Making these trades easier with native BTC — the largest and most trusted digital asset — would mobilize a massive pool of capital, increasing DeFi's liquidity, security, and overall market maturity. More than $2.3 billion worth of wBTC.OFT has already been bridged across 67,000 transfers on LayerZero, the companies said. By enabling direct inflows from native BTC, the gateway could bring fresh liquidity into DeFi markets that rely on wrapped bitcoin as collateral or trading pairs. Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of BOB, said the update “makes wBTC.OFT instantly accessible” across supported chains, while LayerZero’s Simon Baksys described the move as adding utility to “one of the most trusted assets in crypto.” The rollout includes Ethereum, Avalanche, Base, Unichain, Soneium, Bera, Optimism, Sei, Sonic and BOB itself, covering much of the current DeFi landscape."
52472167,Bitcoin Options Tied to BlackRock’s IBIT Are Now Wall Street’s Favorite,"Open interest in IBIT contracts hit nearly $38 billion after Friday’s expiry, versus $32 billion on Deribit, which had dominated the market since 2016.","Shaurya Malwa,James Van Straten",1759229023,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/30/bitcoin-options-tied-to-blackrock-s-ibit-are-now-wall-street-s-favourite,POSITIVE,CoinDesk,"CRYPTOCURRENCY, BTC, MARKET, TRADING, EXCHANGE",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Bitcoin ETF|ETFs|Deribit|News,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund has overtaken Deribit as the largest venue for bitcoin (BTC) options in an indication of how accreditation and institutional capital is reshaping crypto derivatives trading. Open interest in IBIT contracts hit nearly $38 billion after Friday’s expiry, versus $32 billion on Deribit, which had dominated the market since 2016. The flip comes less than a year after IBIT options went live in November. IBIT, already the world’s largest spot bitcoin ETF, with $84 billion in assets, has quickly become a magnet for institutional flows. Its growth cycle is reinforcing liquidity and legitimacy, pulling activity into regulated markets that once sat firmly offshore. Deribit — bought by Coinbase for $2.9 billion in August — remains favored by crypto-native traders. But IBIT’s surge signals a structural power shift as options once driven by high-leverage offshore venues are increasingly anchored in the U.S. Meanwhile, Checkonchain data shows IBIT ETF’s leverage ratio has reached 45%, near all-time highs. The ETF holds 770,000 BTC, while options open interest stands at 340,000 BTC, meaning nearly half of IBIT’s underlying exposure is mirrored in derivatives. This highlights the scale of speculative positioning tied to the ETF, though it is debatable whether this fully reflects market leverage. IBIT now accounts for 45% of global BTC options open interest dominance, overtaking Deribit at 41.9%, with CME at just 6% and other exchanges making up the rest. This concentration indicates that IBIT and Deribit together command almost 90% of the BTC options market. The data suggests two takeaways: IBIT’s growing role in derivatives trading is reshaping the market, and institutional platforms like CME remain small when compared with ETF-driven and retail-dominated venues."

Singapore-based QCP Capital reported on Monday that open interest in perpetuals (futures with no expiration) is increasing, along with funding rates across major centralized and decentralized exchanges, signaling a strong bias toward long positions. “Optimism is re-emerging in the highly leveraged perpetual space. Rather than retreating after last week’s liquidations, leveraged longs are back in force,” the firm’s market insights team said in a Monday update. The team highlighted that cumulative open interest in BTC perpetuals worldwide has increased from $42.8 billion to $43.6 billion. While modest, this increase reflects renewed capital inflows. Meanwhile, annualized funding rates on leading platforms such as Deribit have jumped to 13%. Positive rates indicate that holders of long positions are willing to pay a fee to shorts to keep their positions open. “Hyperliquid’s long bias is also climbing back to 57%, up from just 36% last week,” the team added. Investors’ willingness to pay double-digit funding rates demonstrates growing conviction that prices will continue to rise during the historically bullish fourth quarter. The data also suggest that last week’s volatility did not significantly shake investor confidence. BTC’s price declined in the first four days of the previous week, with the sharpest drop below $109,000 occurring on Thursday. The sell-off led to over $700 million in liquidations of leveraged long positions—the largest single-day figure in at least six months, according to Coinglass. Bitcoin's price has since recovered to trade near $114,000."

The Minnesota-based firm said it has tapped tokenization specialist Superstate as its digital transfer agent, while its equity token will be natively issued through Superstate’s Opening Bell platform, a system designed to issue SEC-registered shares directly on blockchain rails. The move comes as tokenization of financial instruments such as equity is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A slew of tokenized equity offerings debuted in the past few months predominantly for investors outside the U.S., including by Robinhood, Gemini with Dinari, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance. However, some products drew concerns such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulation. SharpLink's tokenized stock will be legally identical to traditional equity, while it can be stored in digital wallets and integrated with on-chain protocols, the press release said. Beyond issuance, SharpLink and Superstate also plan to explore how such shares could eventually trade on decentralized exchanges and automated market makers (AMMs). That step, if approved, would test how tokenized securities can circulate in markets built around smart contracts while remaining compliant with U.S. securities rules. SharpLink's initiative follows digital asset investment firm Galaxy's (GLXY) similar effort to tokenize its Class A common shares on Solana (SOL) with Opening Bell. SBET is lower by 7% in early trading Thursday alongside a steep slide in the price of ETH to below $4,000."

The upgrade, designed to further scale the blockchain, is now scheduled for early December, with follow-up changes aimed at more than doubling blob capacity in the weeks after. Before the Fusaka upgrade reaches Ethereum’s mainnet, developers will push the code through three public test networks in October. If those tests proceed smoothly, the mainnet activation is targeted for Dec. 3. Developers noted that exact epoch numbers and timing will be confirmed in the coming days. While Fusaka itself won’t immediately change blob parameters, the call outlined a phased approach to scaling blob availability through so-called Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks. One week after Fusaka BPO-1 will raise the blog target/max from 6/9 to 10/15, then one week later BPO-2 will push the limit to 14/21. These incremental changes are based on performance observed on the Fusaka Devnet-5 and are intended to safely expand capacity without requiring client-side software updates.

PLASMA BLOCKCHAIN FOR STABLECOINS COMING: Plasma, a new blockchain built specifically for stablecoins, is set to flip the switch on its long-awaited mainnet beta, introducing the chain and its native token, XPL, on Sept. 25. According to a blog post from the team, the network will debut with more than $2 billion in stablecoin liquidity from over a hundred partners on day one — an aggressive attempt to position Plasma not as just another general-purpose chain, but as the backbone for stablecoin transfers. That won’t be an easy feat. Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma’s bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma’s dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape.Token distribution is also aimed at broad accessibility. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering. At launch, 25 million tokens will be allocated to the community, with another 2.5 million reserved for members of the so-called Stablecoin Collective.— Margaux Nijkerk Read more . MIDAS AND INTEROP LAVS UNVEIL NEW LIQUID STAKING TOKEN: Real-world assets (RWA) focused project Midas and Interop Labs unveiled mXRP, an attempt to channel dormant XRP supply into yield-bearing structures the could deliver returns as high as 8%. Announced at XRPL Seoul 2025 on Monday and pitched as the first liquid-staking product tied directly to the XRP ecosystem, the product is minted on XRPL’s EVM through audited contracts. XRP is bridged in and wrapped under Midas’ tokenized certificate framework. MXRP can be used as a structured vehicle that users can slot into existing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, with early strategies including market-making and liquidity provisioning.

This could be the beginning of a new tech stack - one in which AI, not humans, becomes the primary developer of applications, according to Dominic Williams, founder of Internet Computer developer Dfinity. Williams argued that while crypto prices remain driven largely by market mechanics - treasury operations, liquidity games and speculation - the underlying technology will eventually force a reckoning in an interview with CoinDesk. “In the long run, markets begin to reflect realities on the ground,” he said. “But as yet you’re not seeing what’s happening with Internet Computer reflected in ICP’s price.” The Internet Computer first demonstrated neural networks running as smart contracts in April last year, starting with image classification and later facial recognition, Will"

The upgrade, designed to further scale the blockchain, is now scheduled for early December, with follow-up changes aimed at more than doubling blob capacity in the weeks after. Before the Fusaka upgrade reaches Ethereum’s mainnet, developers will push the code through three public test networks in October. If those tests proceed smoothly, the mainnet activation is targeted for Dec. 3. Developers noted that exact epoch numbers and timing will be confirmed in the coming days. Blob Capacity Expansion via BPO Forks While Fusaka itself won’t immediately change blob parameters, the call outlined a phased approach to scaling blob availability through so-called Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks. One week after Fusaka BPO-1 will raise the blog target/max from 6/9 to 10/15, then one week later BPO-2 will push the limit to 14/21. These incremental changes are based on performance observed on the Fusaka Devnet-5 and are intended to safely expand capacity without requiring client-side software updates. Blobs, introduced in March’s Dencun upgrade, allow Ethereum to store large amounts of rollup transaction data more efficiently, reducing costs for users of layer-2 scaling networks. Looking Ahead Ethereum researcher Christine Kim, who reported the call highlights on X , noted that additional BPOs remain on the roadmap for Fusaka, although only the first two were scheduled in this week’s call. A detailed timeline of the Fusaka and BPO activations is available via Ethereum’s public notes . The Fusaka rollout follows May’s Pectra upgrade, which introduced validator staking changes and new account abstraction features, underscoring Ethereum’s ongoing push to optimize scalability and network efficiency."

Marco Santori's comments In an X thread , Santori, a former Kraken CLO, introduced Solmate , which he described as “brand new Solana infrastructure” for the UAE, adding that he will be CEO. He said Solmate is aligned with the Solana Foundation and backed by UAE investors, and he highlighted additional support from Ark Invest, which he characterized as a rare DAT PIPE investment by an ETF. Santori framed Solmate’s remit as a digital asset treasury and crypto infrastructure company focused on SOL-per-share growth for shareholders. Santori outlined the strategy behind the vehicle by calling digital asset treasuries “capital accumulation machines.” In his view, the best DAT is the one with the best access to capital, and he argued the UAE is “the Capitol of Capital.” He said Solmate’s sponsors include the Pulsar Group, positioning the firm to raise fiat and convert it into crypto more efficiently than individual investors. On operations, Santori said Solmate is partnering with RockawayX, which he called a leader in staking infrastructure, and that Viktor Fischer will join the board. The plan includes standing up bare-metal validators in Abu Dhabi to target performance and reliability for staking, with more initiatives to follow. Santori also made a broader case for the Solana ecosystem. He said Solana is the “fastest, most used” blockchain and is growing faster than comparable networks. He contrasted it with Ethereum by saying Solana “delivers what Ethereum promised,” and closed the thread with an emphatic “I’m all in on it.” Comments from analysts on SOL's price action Analyst Rekt Capital said SOL has broken a long-term downtrend and is now retesting about $238 —f ormerly major monthly resistance —a s support on the weekly chart. He sees a successful retest as confirmation that the old ceiling has flipped to a floor, which would keep the path open for attempts at new all-time highs. Trader KALEO said “$1,000+ sol isn’t a meme,” presenting four-figure prices as plausible; he did not specify timing in the post. CoinDesk Research's technical analysis Time window . The analysis covers Sept. 17, 2025, 19:00 UTC to Sept. 18, 2025, 18:00 UTC. What happened . During that window, SOL moved from $233.78 to $250.59 (about +7.2%), swinging about $19.72 in total. That tells us buyers were generally in control during this period. Where buyers showed up . Around 22:00 UTC on Sept. 17, 2025, price pushed above ~$245 on much heavier trading (~2.32M units). “Heavier trading” means more coins changed hands than usual. When price climbs on bigger-than-normal activity, it’s a sign demand is strong enough to overcome sellers. After that push, ~$245 started acting like a floor (support) — traders were willing to buy dips there. Where sellers pushed back . At 17:00 UTC on Sept. 18, 2025, price stalled near ~$253.44 on very high trading (~2.88M units). That shows ~$253 is a ceiling (resistance) — many traders chose to sell or take profit there, absorbing buy orders. How the window ended . Between 17:56 UTC and 18:55 UTC on Sept. 18, 2025, price eased from $251.55 to $250.40. That small, orderly fade after a strong run is typical cool-off or consolidation — the market catching its breath rather than reversing trend. Levels to watch: Floors (support): ~$245 first, ~$238 if ~$245 breaks. Support = areas where buyers have recently stepped in. Ceilings (resistance): ~$252–$253 first, then ~$255–$260 if price gets through ~$253. Resistance = areas where sellers have recently pushed back. Bottom line . Buyers defended ~$245; sellers capped ~$253. A daily/4-hour close above ~$253 (UTC) would likely invite a push toward ~$255–$260. A drop below ~$245 would likely bring a check of $242–$243, then ~$238. Analysis of latest SOL-USD CoinDesk Data charts 24-hour chart (ending Sept. 18, 19:51 UTC): Range $237.01–$252.81; coiling above ~$245 with a ceiling ~$252–$253. Hold ~$245 and a push through ~$253 would likely target ~$255–$260; lose ~$245 and the path is $242–$243, then ~$238. One-month chart (ending Sept. 18, 19:52 UTC): Uptrend of higher highs/lows (roughly $179.71 → $250.50). $238 is the pivot: above it keeps the breakout case clean; below it suggests a pause toward the low $230s before another try higher."

The move allows institutional clients to stake ETH and manage stETH directly from Hex Trust’s custody platform, combining staking rewards with secure, regulated infrastructure. Institutional investors often face barriers when engaging with staking, such as operational complexity and counterparty risks, Hex Trust said. The custody firm’s one-click staking feature removes these hurdles, enabling clients to access staking rewards and decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity tools without setting up their own infrastructure, according to a press release. stETH holders can also deploy their tokens across decentralized finance, including lending, collateral and restaking strategies. “For institutional investors, efficiency and security are not just preferences—they are necessities,” said Calvin Shen, chief commercial officer at Hex Trust. “Our solution provides that critical combination.” The integration reflects a wider shift in crypto markets where institutions are demanding secure pathways into decentralized finance. By combining custody and staking within one platform, Hex Trust positions itself as a bridge for traditional investors seeking exposure to Ethereum’s staking economy.

As of mid-September, roughly 2.5 million ETH — valued at roughly $11.25 billion — is waiting to leave the validator set, according to validator queue dashboards . The backlog pushed exit wait times to more than 46 days on Monday, the longest in Ethereum’s short staking history, dashboards show . The last peak, in August, put the exit queue at 18 days. The initial spark came on Sept. 9, when Kiln, a large infrastructure provider, chose to exit all of its validators as a safety precaution . The move, triggered by recent security incidents including the NPM supply-chain attack and the SwissBorg breach , pushed around 1.6 million ETH into the queue at once. Though unrelated to Ethereum’s staking protocol itself, the hacks rattled confidence enough for Kiln to hit pause, highlighting how events in the broader crypto ecosystem can cascade into Ethereum’s validator dynamics. In a blog post from staking provider Figment, Senior Analyst Benjamin Thalman noted that the current exit queue build up isn’t only about security. After ETH has rallied more than 160% since April, some stakers are simply taking profits. Others, especially institutional players, are shifting their portfolios exposure. At the same time, validators entering the Ethereum staking ecosystem have been steadily rising. The SEC’s May statement clarifying that staking is not a security has renewed interests in staking. Anticipation of ETH ETF approvals is another driver, as funds prepare for regulated ways to capture staking yield, Thalman noted. Ethereum’s churn limit, which is a protocol safeguard that caps how many validators can enter or exit over a certain time period, is currently capped at 256 ETH per epoch (about 6.4 minutes), restricting how quickly validators can join or leave the network, and is meant to keep the network stable. With more than 2.5M ETH lined up, stakers on Wednesday face 44 days before even reaching the cooldown step. Thalman believes that much of the ETH existing will simply be restaked under new validators, meaning that if even 75% of the current queue is re-deposited, nearly 2 million ETH will flood the activation queue, bringing delays for new ETH staking, and a backlog on both sides of the validator queue. “The activation queue is currently 13 days, to this add the ~2M ETH from those currently exiting (35 days) and 4.7M from ETFs (81 days), and the total is 129 days. This assumes that there are no other ETH holders that choose to stake and enter the queue, like corporate treasuries,” Thalman wrote in the blog. The swelling queue underscores a paradox: Ethereum is working ""as intended” Thalman notes, and the demand to both exit and re-enter highlights staking’s central role in the ecosystem. The network is thus experiencing the growing pains of a maturing, institutionalized system where infrastructure scares, profit cycles, and regulatory shifts all collide in real time.

The proof of concept, run under the Swiss Bankers Association, saw UBS, PostFinance, and Sygnum Bank carry out transactions using deposit tokens — digital representations of bank deposits that can move on a public blockchain. The payments were settled legally between banks without relying on the traditional payment system. The transactions were conducted on Ethereum using a permissioned framework. Switzerland already has an efficient domestic payments network, but traditional systems can’t handle programmable conditions or integrate easily with blockchain-based markets, the companies said. With deposit tokens, transfers could in the future be processed instantly and tied to automated conditions through smart contracts. For example, a securities trade could settle as soon as ownership is transferred, or an insurance payout could trigger once a claim is validated. The trial tested two use cases: peer-to-peer payments between customers of different banks and an escrow-like setup where deposit tokens were swapped for tokenized assets. While the project confirmed technical and legal feasibility, scaling the system will require broader participation from banks, infrastructure providers and regulators. The Swiss Bankers Association said the work falls under its strategic priority on digital currencies, but the pilot does not mean deposit tokens will be introduced immediately."

Even as ether hit record highs in late August, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum’s layer-1 (L1) looks muted compared to its peak in late 2021. Fees collected on mainnet in August were just $44 million, a 44% drop from the prior month. Meanwhile, layer-2 (L2) networks like Arbitrum and Base are booming, with $20 billion and $15 billion in total value locked (TVL) respectively. This divergence raises a crucial question: are L2s cannibalizing Ethereum’s DeFi activity, or is the ecosystem evolving into a multi-layered financial architecture? AJ Warner, the chief strategy officer of Offchain Labs, the developer firm behind layer-2 Arbitrum, argues that the metrics are more nuanced than just layer-2 DeFi chipping at the layer 1. In an interview with CoinDesk, Warner said that focusing solely on TVL misses the point, and that Ethereum is increasingly functioning as crypto’s “global settlement layer,” a foundation for high-value issuance and institutional activity. Products like Franklin Templeton’s tokenized funds or BlackRock’s BUIDL product launch directly on Ethereum L1 — activity that isn’t fully captured in DeFi metrics but underscores Ethereum’s role as the bedrock of crypto finance. Ethereum as a layer-1 blockchain is the secure but relatively slow and expensive base network. Layer-2s are scaling networks built on top of it, designed to handle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost before ultimately settling back to Ethereum for security. That’s why they’ve become so appealing to traders and builders alike. Metrics like TVL, the amount of crypto deposited in DeFi protocols, highlight this shift, as activity is moved to L2s where lower fees and quicker confirmations make everyday DeFi far more practical. Warner likens Ethereum’s place in the ecosystem to a wire transfer in traditional finance: trusted, secure and used for large-scale settlement. Everyday transactions, however, are migrating to L2s — the Venmos and PayPals of crypto. “Ethereum was never going to be a monolithic blockchain with all the activity happening on it,” Warner told CoinDesk. Instead, it’s meant to anchor security while enabling rollups to execute faster, cheaper and more diverse applications. Layer 2s, which have exploded over the last few years because they are seen as the faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, enable whole categories of DeFi that don’t function as well on mainnet. Fast-paced trading strategies, like arbitraging price differences between exchanges or running perpetual futures, don’t work well on Ethereum’s slower 12-second blocks. But on Arbitrum, where transactions finalize in under a second, those same strategies become possible, Warner explained. This is apparent, as Ethereum has had fewer than 50 million transactions over the last month, compared to Base’s 328 million transactions and Arbitrum’s 77 million transactions, according to L2Beat . Builders also see L2s as an ideal testing ground. Alice Hou, a research analyst at Messari, pointed to innovations like Uniswap V4’s hooks , customizable features that can be iterated far more cheaply on L2s before going mainstream. For developers, quicker confirmations and lower costs are more than a convenience: they expand what’s possible. “L2s provide a natural playground to test these kinds of innovations, and once a hook achieves breakout popularity, it could attract new types of users who engage with DeFi in ways that weren’t feasible on L1,” Hou said. But the shift isn’t just about technology. Liquidity providers are responding to incentives. Hou said that data shows smaller liquidity providers increasingly prefer L2s where yield incentives and lower slippage amplify returns. Larger liquidity providers, however, still cluster on Ethereum, prioritizing security and depth of liquidity over bigger yields. Interestingly, while L2s are capturing more activity, flagship DeFi protocols like Aave and Uniswap still lean heavily on mainnet. Aave has consistently kept about 90% of its TVL on Ethereum. With Uniswap however, there’s been an incremental shift towards L2 activity. Another factor accelerating L2 adoption is user experience. Wallets, bridges and fiat on-ramps increasingly steer newcomers directly to L2s, Hou said. Ultimately, the data suggests the L1 vs. L2 debate isn’t zero-sum. As of September 2025, about a third of L2 TVL still comes bridged from Ethereum , another third is natively minted, and the rest comes via external bridges. “This mix shows that while Ethereum remains a key source of liquidity, L2s are also developing their own native ecosystems and attracting cross-chain assets,” Hou said. Ethereum thus as a base layer appears to be cementing itself as the secure settlement engine for global finance, while rollups like Arbitrum and Base are emerging as execution layers for fast, cheap and creative DeFi applications. “Most payments I make use something like Zelle or PayPal… but when I boug"

Crapis, who announced the initiative Monday on X, said the new dAI Team will pursue two priorities: enabling AI agents to pay and coordinate without intermediaries, and building a decentralized AI stack that avoids reliance on a small number of large companies. He said Ethereum’s neutrality, verifiability and censorship resistance make it a natural base layer for intelligent systems. Ethereum Foundation background The EF is a non-profit organization based in Zug, Switzerland, that funds and coordinates the development of the Ethereum blockchain. It does not control the network but plays a catalytic role by supporting researchers, developers and ecosystem projects. Its remit includes funding upgrades such as Ethereum 2.0, zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 scaling, alongside community programs like the Ecosystem Support Program. The foundation also organizes events such as Devcon to foster collaboration and acts as a policy advocate for blockchain adoption. In 2025, EF restructured to handle Ethereum’s growth, emphasizing ecosystem acceleration, founder support and enterprise outreach. The new dAI Team represents a continuation of this shift toward specialized units addressing emerging technologies. Crapis’s role Crapis is a research scientist at the EF and will lead the new dAI Team. He said the group will connect its work with both the EF’s protocol group and its ecosystem support arm. “Ethereum makes AI more trustworthy, and AI makes Ethereum more useful,” he wrote, adding that the team intends to fund public goods and projects at the intersection of AI and blockchains. ERC-8004 and Trust Standards The group will build on recent work around ERC-8004, a proposed Ethereum standard that Crapis described as a way to prove who an AI agent is and whether it can be trusted. By offering identity and reputation systems for autonomous agents, the standard is intended to allow coordination without centralized gatekeepers. Crapis said the team will support new standards and upgrades as they emerge, guided by Ethereum’s values and the “d/acc” philosophy of decentralized acceleration. The goal, he explained, is to ensure AI development remains open and verifiable while giving humans greater agency over how intelligent systems interact with the economy. Why it matters For Ethereum, the move signals a growing ambition to anchor emerging technologies beyond finance. If AI agents begin transacting at scale, demand could grow for settlement rails, reputation systems and standards that run natively on Ethereum. For the AI community, the initiative offers an alternative to centralized platforms that currently dominate AI infrastructure. “The more intelligent agents transact, the more they need a neutral base layer for value and reputation,” Crapis said. “Ethereum benefits by becoming that layer and AI benefits by escaping lock-in to a few centralized platforms.” The team has begun hiring and publishing resources, according to Crapis. He said EF intends to work “with purpose and urgency” to connect AI developers with the Ethereum ecosystem and to accelerate research at the boundary of the two fields."

The validators were tied to the SSV Network, a distributed validator technology (DVT) protocol that decentralizes staking infrastructure by splitting validator keys across multiple operators. Despite the scale of the incident, SSV founder Alon Muroch emphasized that the protocol itself was not compromised. Instead, the penalties stemmed from operator-side infrastructure issues involving third-party staking providers using SSV. One cluster of slashed validators was tied to Ankr, a liquid staking provider. According to Muroch, routine maintenance on Ankr’s systems triggered the event. A second slashing involved a validator cluster that had migrated from Allnodes two months earlier. Investigators believe a secondary validator setup caused the duplicate signing that led to penalties. In total, 39 validators were slashed, making this one of the largest correlated slashing events since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. Each validator slashed faces an immediate ETH penalty and could face inactivity leaks , compounded losses. One validator, backed by a 2,020 ETH stake, lost around 0.3 ETH , or about $1,300 at today’s prices, in the process. While slashing is built into Ethereum’s design as a deterrent against malicious or negligent behavior, it remains exceedingly rare. Fewer than 500 validators out of more than 1.2 million active have been slashed since the Beacon Chain went live in 2020. Most incidents, including this one, have been traced to operator issues rather than deliberate attacks. Mass slashings are particularly notable because correlated misbehavior increases the severity of penalties. Ethereum’s protocol enforces additional inactivity leaks when groups of validators are slashed together, amplifying the financial impact. For Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, the latest wave underscores a familiar but critical lesson: validator safety hinges as much on infrastructure and operator diligence as on the protocol itself. Even when the underlying software is uncompromised, operational errors can have costly and very public consequences. Read more: ‘Keep It Simple’: Prevent Your Eth 2.0 From Being Slashed"

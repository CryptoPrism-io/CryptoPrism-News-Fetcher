53457330,Brian Armstrong Burns $25M NFT to Force Up Only TV Comeback,2025-10-21 19:41:09,cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/brian-armstrong-burns-25m-nft-to-force-up-only-tv-comeback/,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,AA News|Crypto News|Brian Armstrong,EN,Crypto Potato,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has spent $25 million to buy and burn a one-of-a-kind NFT that controls the return of Up Only TV, the cult-favorite crypto podcast hosted by Cobie and LedgerStatus. The symbolic burn immediately triggered excitement across Crypto Twitter, reigniting memories of the 2021 bull run that the show helped define. Armstrong Revives a Crypto Classic The story began on May 7, when Cobie, real name Jordan Fish, minted an NFT that he claimed would determine the fate of Up Only. The token, inscribed with “ADMISSION: 1 SEASON OF UP ONLY TV,” gave its holder the power to “compel Cobie and LedgerStatus into performing eight episodes.” He wrote at the time, “When the NFT is burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone.” This week, Armstrong entered the picture, revealing that his company had bought the NFT. “The rumors are true, we bought the NFT. @Up Only TV is coming back,” posted the Coinbase co-founder. While the exact price was not officially confirmed, on-chain data analyzed by commentators suggested a transaction worth 6,500 ETH, or approximately $25 million. Cobie, who had earlier resisted calls to revive the show, leaned into the moment with humor: “It has been 3 years since UpOnly ended. I was in my 20s when it started, now I have grey hair,” he joked. “We will rename it Unc Only and I will spend $25m on cosmetic surgery.” Crypto users across X reacted with excitement: “UpOnly spawned some of the best and funniest crypto lore,” wrote crypto researcher Aylo. “Pretty sure every single active person on here will be tuning in.” Others, like Rhino, questioned whether the new season could live up to its past, noting that there aren’t anywhere near the level of interesting main characters that had been around in the last cycle. Cobie himself admitted that finding good guests could be challenging, mentioning possible appearances from Arthur Hayes and prediction market experts, but no confirmed list yet. Nostalgia and Market Timing The Up Only revival lands at a time when the crypto community could use a morale boost. Just last week, the market suffered a sharp downturn, with over $19 billion worth of leveraged positions liquidated following renewed U.S.–China trade tensions. Cobie used that collapse to remind traders about the risks of over-leverage, saying that “fighting that feeling and avoiding the wipeouts is worth it in the end.” Still, the podcaster is tempering expectations, writing that the show’s return won’t magically “bring back 2021 vibes.” However, going by the online comments, for much of the crypto community, even a short UpOnly reboot feels like a spark of optimism after months of market exhaustion. As one fan put it when Cobie announced he was putting down the mic: “One more UpOnly season for my children. One more UpOnly for Satoshi.” At the same time, the relationship between Cobie and Coinbase will go beyond the company’s revival of the Up Only podcast, with the exchange announcing its acquisition of Echo, an early-stage crypto investment platform founded by Cobie. The deal is worth about $375 million, made up of cash and stock, and will be subject to purchase price adjustments.

The move followed a weekend rebound from below $104,000, but analysts now warn that weak derivatives activity and upcoming U.S. inflation data could bring more turbulence. Short-Lived Uptick Reveals Market Fatigue At first, the price rise from $106,000 to nearly $112,000 seemed positive, but an assessment by analyst CryptoMe, shared on social media on October 21, shows that key market metrics tell a different story. According to the market technician, Open Interest, which reflects the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts, did not climb significantly during BTC’s price ascent. CryptoMe interpreted this as little appetite for opening new leveraged positions. Furthermore, the funding rate stayed below the neutral level of 0.01, and CME futures saw low volume, meaning traders weren’t willing to pay extra to keep long positions. “In short, there wasn’t the aggressive liquidity inflow or position-opening enthusiasm we were hoping for,” wrote the analyst. This technical weakness comes at a sensitive time. On Friday, October 24, the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be released. All financial markets pay close attention to this inflation report, and in the past, it has caused big price swings in cryptocurrencies. A higher-than-expected figure could put a lot of downward pressure on Bitcoin, with the current market structure showing that buyers are mostly concentrated between $97,500 and $104,000, while the $100,000 level serves as an important psychological support. “There’s visible demand in this range. But don’t forget, psychological supports are not very strong supports,” CryptoMe cautioned. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data shows that Bitcoin has dropped 2.5% in the last 24 hours and 4.6% in the past week. The flagship cryptocurrency is now worth 14.5% less than its all-time high recorded on October 6, when it exceeded $126,000. Market capitalization stands at roughly $2.15 trillion, with daily trading volume around $60 billion. Analysts Split on Next Move Given its recent performances, observers are divided over Bitcoin’s next direction. Dr. Profit recently told followers that “bulls will be proven wrong,” predicting a drop below $101,000 soon, while veteran trader Bob Loukas warned that “complacency here is dangerous” as Bitcoin enters a critical point in its four-year cycle. On the other hand, CryptoAmsterdam suggested in a post today that BTC has “reclaimed the range low” and could still hold it as mid-term support, even though a deeper retrace is possible if that level breaks. On his part, Titan of Crypto noted that the monthly LMACD cross, still unconfirmed, could signal either a cycle top or the start of a bear phase.

At the time of writing, ETH was priced at around $3,900, with a daily trading volume of $33.3 billion. The token has declined 4% in the last 24 hours and 3% over the past week. Price Sits Below Prior High Ethereum is trading just below its former peak, a level last tested before the 2020 rally. According to Cryptocium, the structure today looks nearly the same. In both periods, ETH paused at resistance after months of consolidation and later broke out with momentum. $ETH – History Repeats Itself Ethereum might seem slow right now, but in reality, it’s forming the exact same price action we saw back in the 2020 cycle. ETH is sitting at its previous ATH level, while the RSI is retesting its bearish trendline. Same thing, different time, pic.twitter.com/v7YV7pvzNM — Cryptocium (@Cryptocium_id) October 21, 2025 Notably, the current resistance area is around $4,000 to $4,100. Analysts have noted that ETH needs to close above this level to confirm any continued move. Until then, the price remains in a zone that has rejected attempts to climb higher. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also follows a familiar path. During the 2020 move, RSI spent months under a trendline before breaking out just ahead of the rally. ETH is now testing a similar line again. Cryptocium described the setup as “ the same thing, different time ,” noting how the current RSI structure matches the previous one. If the RSI pushes through, it may suggest a shift in momentum. For now, traders are watching to see if the pattern holds. Traders Monitor $3,900–$4,100 Zone Javon Marks posted a chart showing Ethereum retesting the breakout zone near $3,900. He noted that a measured move from this setup could put ETH above $8,000 if the level holds. This type of projection uses the height of the previous range to estimate the next move. DaanCrypto said , “ You’d want to see some daily close above that point ,” referring to the $4,100 area. Other analysts added that a drop to $3,750 would open the door for long setups if a bounce follows. If not, the price may test lower ranges. Large Buyers Remain Active While price action has been mixed, institutional demand continues. BitMine Immersion Technologies made another Ether purchase this week. The company acquired $250 million worth of ETH from Bitgo and Kraken, as CryptoPotato reported . Funds also charted inflows. Ethereum-based products took in $205 million over the last week. A 2x leveraged ETP brought in $457 million, showing that large players are still positioning during this consolidation.

Visa’s latest research confirms this shift, illustrating how blockchain-based credit is transitioning from niche DeFi circles into mainstream institutional finance. The global payments giant’s newly released white paper signals a major milestone in the recognition of stablecoins as critical instruments for the future of global credit infrastructure. Visa’s Report Signals a New Era for On-Chain Lending Visa’s in-depth report , Stablecoins Beyond Payments: The On-Chain Lending Opportunity, explores how tokenized dollars are reshaping traditional credit systems. The company notes that the on-chain lending market has already originated more than $670 billion in stablecoin loans over the past five years, with borrowing volumes reaching around $51.7 billion monthly as of mid-2025. According to Visa, programmable stablecoins, those that integrate seamlessly with smart contracts, can unlock vast potential in lending, collateralization, and credit markets. Visa is now highlighting Ripple’s RLUSD alongside USDC & USDT in its new report on stablecoins powering on-chain lending. It’s a sign that RLUSD built for institutions, multi-chain, and regulation-ready is stepping beyond payments into real credit market infrastructure.… pic.twitter.com/1Hngu5OD0A — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) October 20, 2025 The report suggests that financial institutions are beginning to view these blockchain-based assets not merely as a means of transferring value, but as the building blocks of new credit architectures that operate continuously, without the constraints of legacy systems. Why Ripple’s RLUSD Inclusion Is a Landmark Development Among the stablecoins analyzed in Visa’s report are USDT, USDC, and Ripple’s RLUSD — a lineup that signals a profound recognition of Ripple’s growing institutional footprint. RLUSD, launched by Ripple in late 2024, was designed as a regulation-ready, multi-chain stablecoin aimed at meeting the liquidity and compliance demands of global financial institutions. Its inclusion alongside market leaders USDT and USDC in Visa’s data set underscores that Ripple’s dollar-backed token is being treated as a legitimate participant in institutional credit markets. This distinction suggests that RLUSD has progressed far beyond its payments-oriented origins, moving into use cases such as treasury management, institutional settlement, and on-chain lending infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As Visa frames it, the emergence of compliant, transparent stablecoins like RLUSD creates an environment in which financial institutions can safely integrate blockchain-based liquidity into their credit and risk management frameworks. BankXRP Draws Attention to Visa’s Recognition Crypto market commentator BankXRP was among the first to spotlight Visa’s mention of RLUSD on X. In their post, BankXRP highlighted how Visa’s decision to list RLUSD alongside industry heavyweights marks a pivotal step for Ripple, positioning the company to play a deeper role in credit market modernization. The observation quickly gained traction among XRP supporters and industry analysts, many of whom interpreted Visa’s acknowledgment as a sign that Ripple’s stablecoin is crossing into mainstream financial consciousness — not just as a blockchain payment asset, but as a tool for real institutional liquidity. A Glimpse Into the Future of Credit Infrastructure Visa’s research envisions a world where tokenized dollars like RLUSD anchor a 24/7, automated lending ecosystem powered by programmable finance. With stablecoins serving as real-time collateral and settlement instruments, the traditional boundaries between payments, lending, and credit issuance could blur entirely. For Ripple, this development is validation that its strategy — integrating compliance, liquidity, and interoperability into RLUSD — is resonating with the very institutions that will define the next phase of digital finance. If adoption continues along this trajectory, Visa’s acknowledgment of RLUSD could mark the start of a broader institutional embrace, where Ripple’s technology becomes a cornerstone of how global credit truly moves.

According to Moonchaser, many XRP fans misunderstand how market value works by claiming that XRP has no market cap. The economist highlighted that XRP, like any other asset or cryptocurrency, is affected by supply, demand, and liquidity. Economist Explains The Reality Behind Price Reaching $100,000 Moonchaser, who studied economics and previously worked as a forex analyst, says that some people in the XRP community believe the token can reach extreme prices because they think it has “no market cap.” This idea, Moonchaser explains, is built on a misunderstanding of how currencies are valued and traded in real-world markets. In their view, economic principles apply equally to all assets, whether they are fiat money, commodities, or digital tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin 3rd Cycle Explosion: Analyst Revels The Only Difference From Last Two Cycles Using the U.S. dollar as an example, Moonchaser notes that every currency has a measurable total value based on the amount in circulation and its global trade. The dollar’s value changes daily because of the balance between supply, demand, and liquidity. The same rule applies to the XRP price, which also trades across international markets and follows the same market laws. It means that XRP’s price is not free from limits and cannot simply rise endlessly based on belief or community hype. Moonchaser stresses that ignoring these realities creates unrealistic expectations within the XRP community. According to them, calling XRP a “currency” does not make it limitless in value; instead, XRP functions within the same market framework that governs all other financial assets. XRP Can’t Overtake Bitcoin Due To Market Structure In their post, Moonchaser further explains that market capitalization, which is price multiplied by circulating supply, applies to every form of tradable asset. Whether it’s fiat money, gold, or a digital coin, traders can always calculate the total market value. XRP is no exception to this rule. The economist points out that XRP has a measurable circulating supply and a price that moves through normal market discovery, where the balance between buyers and sellers directly determines its potential value, not wishful thinking. “Currency does not mean a capless asset,” Moonchaser says, reminding traders that every market has structure and limits. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin Price Could Still Hit A 600% Rally To Send It Above $1.5 Moonchaser emphasizes that their comments do not spread fear or negativity toward XRP. Instead, they want XRP investors to understand the realistic economic structure behind its price movement. XRP’s market position depends on measurable data, not speculation about infinite growth. The economist concludes that this is not FUD—it is simply market reality based on economics. Through this explanation, Moonchaser helps the XRP community see that price growth depends on genuine demand and market behavior, not dreams of capless value. While XRP continues to be an essential player in digital finance, the idea of it reaching $100,000 or surpassing Bitcoin remains far from economic reality.

At this point, the latest news came from Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. Coinbase said today that it has acquired investment platform Echo in a cash-and-stock deal worth approximately $375 million and aims to bring fundraising tools to its platform. While the official statement came from Coinbase, Echo founder and online nickname Cobie, Jordan Fish, also confirmed the agreement on the social media platform X. Coinbase stated that the reason for investing in Echo was very simple and that by acquiring Echo, they wanted to create more accessible, efficient and transparent capital markets. Fish said Echo will remain a standalone platform under its existing branding for now, but he plans to integrate Echo's public token sale product, Sonar, into Coinbase. Coinbase explained that the deal will allow startups to secure custom-designed fundraising mechanisms tailored to their user bases and expand opportunities for investors to directly access early-stage projects. Coinbase also acquired a special NFT from Echo founder Jordan Fish for $25 million yesterday. Cobie had announced that if his “Up Only” NFT was purchased, he would resume his podcast, which he had paused since the FTX crash at the end of 2022. Coinbase has been attracting attention with its acquisitions this year. Its $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives exchange, has garnered considerable attention.

The Singapore-based exchange confirmed users can now transact stablecoins directly through Polkadot’s Asset Hub, the specialized parachain for transferring non-native tokens and creating NFTs using smart contracts. According to Polkadot’s website insight, the Asset Hub is a Layer 1 bridge for non-native tokens and an experimental ground for decentralized asset management. Crypto.com activates stablecoin Asset Hub transactions post-migration The announcement comes exactly three weeks after Binance supported Polkadot and its sister network Kusama to migrate from Layer 0 metaprotocols to Asset Hubs. Developers of the protocols explained that the transition helps users manage their assets in the Polkadot ecosystem effectively by improving compatibility for token issuers and DeFi platforms. Deposits and withdrawals of USDT and USDC via Polkadot Asset Hub have just been enabled on the https://t.co/vCNztATkNg App. Launch the App 👉 https://t.co/JsWd2MG4O7 @Polkadot pic.twitter.com/5n60RuURjh — Crypto.com (@cryptocom) October 21, 2025 In the Polkadot Asset Hub, assets are categorized as either “sufficient” or “non-sufficient” to determine if an account needs a native token balance to hold certain assets. A non-sufficient asset can only exist in an account that already has a minimum native balance, referred to as the Existential Deposit (ED). The threshold for Polkadot is 0.01 DOT, while on the Kusama Asset Hub, it is 0.000003333 KSM, both ten times smaller than the EDs on their respective Relay Chains. Sending a non-sufficient asset requires the recipient account to meet the ED requirement. On the other side, sufficient assets do not require the account to have any balance of the native token. Polkadot has mentioned that the first sufficient assets available on its Asset Hub are USDC and USDT, identified by asset IDs 1337 and 1984, respectively. Other assets available include Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Ether (wETH), Kusama (KSM), alongside foreign assets transferred via cross-chain bridges Snowbridge and Polkadot Kusama bridge. Asset Hub users are being asked to verify the authenticity of tokens before making any transactions, as anyone can create and name assets on the Asset Hub using similar names and try to defraud them. Crypto.com integrates service in Brazilian retail trading platform At the end of the previous business week, Crypto.com completed its integration with SpiderTrader, a Brazilian trading platform catering to thousands of active retail traders. The integration has made SpiderTrader the exchange’s first fully integrated broker in Brazil, granting the latter company access to Crypto.com’s trading engine on the SpiderTrader interface. “This partnership with SpiderTrader marks an important step in our strategy to collaborate with regionally trusted platforms. Brazil and the wider LATAM region are vibrant markets for crypto adoption, and this integration allows us to better serve local users through trusted partnerships,” Karl Turner, Director at Crypto.com Exchange, said in a recent press briefing. Company activities continue in South Korea In other related news covered by Cryptopolitan, Crypto.com announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korean fintech company Travel Wallet. Travel Wallet, founded in the year 2017, has garnered more than eight million users and provides multi-currency wallets and global payment cards services in over 40 fiat currencies. Under the agreement, Travel Wallet will become Crypto.com’s preferred issuing partner in South Korea, which will see it launch a co-branded prepaid card for users to spend both fiat and crypto globally. The companies will also collaborate on integrating Crypto.com’s “crypto-as-a-service” (CaaS) technology into the Travel Wallet app to trade and hold virtual assets directly within the platform. Crypto.com also mentioned that the collaboration will jointly promote Travel Wallet’s KRW-denominated stablecoin in both ecosystems and improve cross-border payment efficiency through fast and low-cost transactions. “Travel Wallet will build a unified payment ecosystem encompassing foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. This move is set to significantly elevate the global competitiveness of Korea’s fintech industry,” said CEO of Travel Wallet Kim Hyung-woo. Still within the Asian jurisdiction, the crypto trading platform revealed it will participate in the upcoming APEC CEO Summit Korea 2025 as the event’s official partner.

On Monday, Argentina’s central bank announced it had inked a $20 billion exchange rate stabilization deal with the U.S. Treasury Department. The deal brought the total amount of U.S. assistance for the third-largest economy in Latin America to $40 billion. Argentina’s central bank stated, “These operations will enable the Central Bank of the Argentinian Republic (BCRA) to broaden its range of monetary and exchange rate policy tools, including the liquidity of its foreign reserves.” U.S. banks stall Argentina’s $20 billion loan over collateral According to a WSJ report, the banks are looking for a pledge or guarantee to ensure they receive their money back. The report confirmed that bankers are awaiting word from the Treasury Department over what collateral Argentina can offer them or whether Washington intends to support the facility independently. In the report, analysts said that the banks cannot take action without Washington’s support. They claimed the Treasury has been overseeing the larger package, even though banks typically set up these kinds of rescue facilities on their own. The analysts argued that if the banks’ collateral question is not answered, the lending facility, which hasn’t been formalized, might not come together. A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said, “discussions on this facility remain ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more details when these talks are complete.” The report also revealed that U.S. banks haven’t been lending to Argentina and have been shut out of the international capital markets for years. Successive governments have borrowed dollars or printed money rather than cutting spending to narrow chronic budget gaps, leading to runaway inflation. The third-biggest economy in Latin America has missed nine sovereign debt payments, including three since 2000. The IMF has provided the Argentine government with more than 20 bailouts to close the gap since the 1950s. The bailouts include a facility that was agreed to earlier this year. U.S. Treasury intervenes to stabilize Argentina’s falling peso As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that the Treasury had “directly purchased Argentine pesos” as part of the program. Bessent stated that the peso’s decline and shrinking central bank foreign reserves have left the country in a “moment of acute illiquidity.” The Treasury secretary explained that the swap line would give Argentina immediate access to U.S. dollars in exchange for pesos. The Argentinian peso closed at a record low, down 1.7% on the day to end at 1,475 per dollar. Bessent admitted that the U.S. might suffer losses if the peso’s value declined during the swap period. The Treasury Secretary reassured policymakers that the USD-Peso exchange was being carried out via an Exchange Stabilization Fund under his direct supervision. Some nations, like Mexico, have pledged other assets to protect U.S. taxpayers in similar transactions. Brad Setser, the Whitney Shepardson senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), stated that the peso is steadily losing value. He added that the peso could continue to decline if the IMF compels the government to allow it to float and have its price determined by market forces freely. “The risks from these operations are unusually large. Should the peso depreciate, which many think is not only likely but necessary, the Treasury would be left holding assets that have fallen in value.” – Brad Setser , Whitney Shepardson, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

53456025,XRP ETF Key Deadlines That Could Drive Altcoin Market This Week,2025-10-21 19:05:40,timestabloid,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-key-deadlines-that-could-drive-altcoin-market-market-this-week/,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,Cryptocurrency|News|XRP|XRP ETF,EN,TimesTabloid,"A series of approaching deadlines for XRP-related ETF applications has placed regulatory timing back into focus for digital asset observers. Coin Bureau shared a timetable showing when several asset managers are set to receive decisions or further action on their filings, presenting a clustered window that could carry broader implications for institutional accessibility to XRP. Key Dates for Major Applicants The schedule outlines a sequence beginning with Grayscale on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, and Bitwise on October 20. Canary Capital is listed for October 23, WisdomTree for October 25, and Franklin Templeton on November 14. This succession of dates underscores how multiple firms are seeking to formalize XRP exposure through regulated investment products, concentrating attention on how the regulatory landscape may respond within a short timeframe.

Will ETF approvals move the altcoin market? pic.twitter.com/K9Ynq4nx5r — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) October 19, 2025 Institutional Access and Regulatory Considerations The timing of these filings has prompted commentary around the potential impact of approvals, particularly in the context of broader market conditions and procedural constraints. One observer noted concerns regarding the disruption of government activity, suggesting that administrative delays could influence the outcome. Another pointed out that while ETF approvals may not drive immediate market surges, they play a significant role in shaping credibility. By offering structured, compliant investment vehicles, ETFs can increase confidence among institutional participants and create pathways for larger capital inflows over time .

Approval of such products would indicate recognition of XRP as an asset suitable for regulated markets, expanding its reach beyond retail access. Even if prices are not moved immediately, the presence of multiple prominent asset managers pursuing similar products signals sustained institutional interest. Each deadline will serve as a reference point for gauging regulatory posture and appetite for new digital asset offerings. Focus Shifts to Regulatory Outcomes With six distinct dates now clearly outlined, attention will turn to how decision-makers approach these applications. Whether approvals, delays, or requests for additional information are issued, each response will contribute to the broader narrative around digital asset legitimacy in traditional financial infrastructure. For observers, these developments are less about rapid price reaction and more about the long-term framework being built around institutional engagement with XRP.

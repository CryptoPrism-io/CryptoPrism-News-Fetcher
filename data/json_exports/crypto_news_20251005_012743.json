Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns. Professional mining services allow you to participate in this growth without the technical complexities. As energy costs rise globally, individual mining becomes increasingly impractical, while professional operations benefit from economies of scale and renewable energy sources. This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

      "title": "Abracadabra appears to have been hacked for the third time in two years",
      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/abracadabra-money-hit-suspected-hack/",
      "body": "Abracadabra Money, an omnichain DeFi lending platform behind the Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin, has reportedly suffered another exploit resulting in the loss of roughly $1.7 million in digital assets. The claim, posted by several researchers on X, marks the latest security incident for the project, which has previously been targeted by hackers. According to Vladimir S ., a blockchain threat researcher with the X handle, @officer_cia, the protocol was drained of $1.7 million before the attacker transferred the stolen funds into Tornado Cash . The researcher’s claim followed an earlier post on X by Weilin William Li (@hklst4r), who had flagged the incident as a vulnerability in Abracadabra’s smart contracts but stopped short of confirming the exploit at the time. Vulnerability in ‘solvency check’ logic Li said the suspected attacker may have exploited a flaw in the protocol’s logic that allowed them to bypass a solvency check, a safeguard designed to ensure that borrowers cannot withdraw more funds than they are entitled to. “It seems Abracadabra @MIM_Spell is hacked again,” Li wrote . “This time a more obvious vulnerability, where an ‘else’ branch clears the status variables and sets ‘needSolvencyCheck’ to false by default.” Li also implied that Abracadabra Money was already aware of the situation as he wrote “They have paused all their contracts now,” while cautioning that his findings were preliminary and could be subject to revision. Abracadabra Money is a familiar target for hackers If confirmed, this would be the third exploit the platform has suffered in roughly two years. The first was in January 2024, when it suffered a $6.49 million exploit. That exploit caused its MIM stablecoin to lose its peg to the US dollar. The second exploit occurred in March 2025; the protocol lost an estimated $13 million after attackers exploited vulnerabilities in its “cauldron” smart contracts tied to GMX. That’s the largest breach the platform has suffered to date, and it caused Abracadabra to pause borrowing across its ecosystem and offered a 20% bounty to the hackers for the safe return of funds. DeFi’s persistent security challenges Abracadabra Money’s recurring vulnerabilities have drawn criticism from parts of the DeFi community. The relatively modest amount involved, $1.7 million compared to earlier multi-million-dollar DeFi exploits, may indicate a partial drain or that the vulnerability was discovered and mitigated before further damage occurred. An estimated $307 million is reported to have been stolen from crypto platforms globally in the third quarter (Q3) of 2025, with DeFi exploits coming second after centralized exchanges, according to data shared by CertiK. This is an improvement to the figures that were lost to exploits in Q2 and Q1. This year alone has seen over $3 billion lost to hacks. With Q4 just starting, Abracadabra Money is one of the first casualties of the quarter. As of the time of writing, Abracadabra Money has yet to issue an official statement addressing the reported exploit. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

      "body": "Ethereum’s steward moved part of its crypto coffers this week, converting a chunk of ETH into stablecoins as it adjusts how it funds projects and grants. Foundation Moves To Stablecoin Holdings According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation converted 1,000 ETH into stablecoins using the decentralized trading router CoW Swap, a transaction worth about $4.5 million at the time. The move was executed as part of the foundation’s ongoing treasury actions and was presented as a step to secure more predictable funds for research, grants, and donations. The specific stablecoin or coins received in exchange were not publicly named in initial reports. The Foundation’s treasurer has been managing a broader plan. Reports have disclosed a previously stated intention to convert up to 10,000 Ether over a period of weeks, and this latest trade appears to be an element of that phased approach rather than a one-off sale. Holding stable assets gives the foundation a clearer view of its short-term spending power while it evaluates longer-term strategy. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap ‘s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Use Of Decentralized Trading Tools The choice to use CoW Swap — a decentralized aggregator that aims to reduce slippage and market impact — was highlighted in public coverage. By routing the trade through decentralized infrastructure instead of a single centralized exchange, the Foundation reduced some counterparty and custody concerns. The execution method was described as careful and aimed at protecting the value of the sale during the swap. Alongside the transaction, internal operational decisions have also been articulated. The Foundation indicated it temporarily applied the breaks on open submissions of a grant for its Ecosystem Support Program in order to give attention to the large influx of proposals and prioritize urgent or high-impact work. Changes in leadership and institutional reorganization, have also been discussed publicly as part of recent organizational action, portrayed in a manner that suggests a transition is underway internally to accompany any change in the direction of treasury management as well. What Comes Next For The Treasury Market watchers noted that converting ETH to stablecoins is a common liquidity-management tactic. Volatility in ETH’s price can make budgeting for multi-month support programs difficult; stable assets can smooth out planning. While some community members saw the sale as a reduction of ETH holdings, others pointed out that the foundation’s core mission — to support Ethereum’s development — remains unchanged.

      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/arbitrum-price-prediction/",
      "body": "Key takeaways: Our ARB predictions anticipate a high of $0.82 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $1.01 and $1.22, with an average price of $1.04. In 2030, it will range between $2.98 and $3.51, with an average price of $3.08. Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. Arbitrum led the Layer 2 pack with a total value locked ( TVL ) of $2.53 billion. Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining Ethereum-level security. Arbitrum’s BOLD testnet also went live; when integrated into the mainnet, the update will enable permissionless validation on Arbitrum. This means that anyone can challenge the state of the Arbitrum network. Currently, validators are allow-listed. Is Arbitrum a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in 5 years? Let’s answer these questions and more in our Arbitrum price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Arbitrum Ticker ARB Current price $0.4326 Market cap $2.33B Trading volume $207.99 Circulating supply 5.4B All-time high $2.40 on Jan 12, 2024 All-time low $0.245 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.4563 24-hour low $0.4274 Arbitrum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 8.68% 50-day SMA $0.4877 200-day SMA $0.4111 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Arbitrum price analysis On October 4, Arbitrum’s price rose by 3.14% over 24 hours to $0.4326, while its trading volume decreased by 32.38% during the same period. Looking back, ARB had a steep decline in April, which saw it register its lowest price since launch at $0.245. It has since recovered the losses. ARB 1-day chart analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB has support at $0.4085 and trades below major SMA and EMA levels, signaling a bearish market. The MACD histogram (0.0009) confirms little momentum, while the RSI (42.57) is in neutral territory. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. The drop comes after ARB broke below $0.4870 last month. Arbitrum price 4-hour chart price analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that ARB registers negative momentum and that its volatility is dropping. The charts’ short candles are indicative of a bear market. The MACD histograms show its negative momentum rose over the last 16 hours.

ARB’s dip reflects natural profit-taking after a strong quarter and shifting focus toward competing L2 developments. While the network’s fundamentals (DeFi dominance, Robinhood’s RWA integrations) remain intact, traders are cautiously awaiting clearer signals. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news SWIFT announced its blockchain will use Linea (Ethereum L2), challenging Arbitrum’s dominance in institutional adoption. Linea’s TVL ($2.27B) now ranks fourth among L2s. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

Global leaders warn as tech giants drive valuations beyond fundamentals 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Over 50% of the US market cap is now pure Tech. Defensives have collapsed to under 15%. This isn’t diversification – it’s a Tech Empire 🇺🇸🇺🇸 $tsla $nvda $google $appl #Bitcoin $qqq pic.twitter.com/taa4SxxSME — Hod | Code2Capital (@HodTzdaka) October 3, 2025 David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, warned on Friday at Italian Tech Week in Turin, that an AI investment frenzy may be overdone and that stock markets are due for a “drawdown.” Solomon said major US stock indexes have notched record high after record high this year on the promise of artificial intelligence. He argued that there’s a good chance that not all of those investments will deliver big returns. He noted that the internet craze of the late 1990s and early 2000s drew a frenzy of investment in tech companies at the time. Solomon reminded the crowd that the internet craze was followed by a dramatic collapse, which is commonly known as the “dot-com bubble”. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets.” David Solomon , Goldman Sachs CEO Jeff Bezos referred to the AI investment wave as an “industrial bubble.” He also emphasized that innovation stemming from such AI investment cycles can still yield long-term advantages. According to Bezos, the market is seeking the next big breakthrough, reminiscent of the dynamics of previous bubbles. He added that the previous bubble dynamic is why many small AI ventures with weak foundations receive investment. On October 3, Dario Perkins, TS Lombard’s Managing Director of Global Macro Research, raised an alarm when he noticed that big tech companies were increasingly using off-balance-sheet loans and special purpose entities (SPVs) to finance AI equipment. According to Perkins, this is a “recognition that this is getting out of hand.” Perkins emphasized that the real leverage and risk exposure of businesses like Meta, which has requested $29 billion in private finance for the expansion of its AI data centre, are concealed by such borrowing techniques.

      "body": "Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.24 billion in the first week of October, driving large institutional demand and pushing BTC toward the $125,000 resistance. This surge — including a near $1 billion daily inflow — signals renewed allocation to Bitcoin from investors anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut. $3.24B total ETF inflows in first week of October $1B nearly one-day inflow reversed prior $900M outflow Analyst targets: JPMorgan $165k, Standard Chartered $135k–$200k, Citigroup $132k Bitcoin ETFs pull in $3.24B in early October, sparking renewed institutional buying and driving BTC toward $125K — read the latest market signals and analyst forecasts. What caused Bitcoin ETF inflows to surge to $3.2B? Bitcoin ETF inflows surged as institutional investors returned after a weak September, driven by optimism for an “Uptober” rally and a sharply higher probability of a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. The inflows included one of the largest single-day ETF deposits, signaling renewed capital allocation into BTC. How large were the flows and what do they mean for price action? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs registered about $3.24 billion in net inflows during the first week of October, with nearly $1 billion entering on Friday alone. This reversed a roughly $900 million outflow from the previous week and coincided with Bitcoin briefly touching $124,000, placing $125,000 as the next clear resistance. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Bitcoin ETFs Hit $3.2B in Flows, Setting the Stage for a Breakout\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T22:05:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T22:05:00Z\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-etfs-hit-3-2b-flows\" }, \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.24B in early October, sparking renewed institutional buying and pushing BTC toward $125K as analysts update targets.\", \"keywords\": \"Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC price, Uptober, institutional adoption\"} Why did institutions return to Bitcoin funds now? Institutions cited macro drivers and portfolio rebalancing. Futures markets are pricing in more than a 90% chance of a Federal Reserve policy easing, which historically favors alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Wealth managers and financial advisors reported renewed client interest in crypto exposure. What are major banks forecasting for Bitcoin? Major banks have revised targets upward: JPMorgan projects $165,000 by year-end, Standard Chartered sets nearer-term targets of $135,000 with upside to $200,000 before 2026 if ETF demand persists, and Citigroup raised its target to $132,000. These projections were shared in institutional research notes and public commentary. How should investors interpret ETF flow data? ETF flows offer a near-real-time gauge of institutional demand. A sustained inflow trend typically precedes broader price appreciation as new capital increases liquidity and lowers volatility for large buy orders. How to monitor ETF-driven momentum (step-by-step) Track daily and weekly net flows for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Compare flows with on-chain metrics (exchange reserves, open interest). Monitor macro signals (Fed minutes, rate-cut probabilities) for directional bias. Watch resistance levels ($125K) and volume confirmation for breakout validation. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret Bitcoin ETF inflows\", \"description\": \"Steps for investors to use ETF flows to assess Bitcoin market momentum and risk.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check ETF net flows\", \"text\": \"Review daily and weekly inflows and outflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs to identify demand trends.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Cross-check on-chain indicators\", \"text\": \"Compare ETF flows with exchange reserves and futures open interest for liquidity signals.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Factor in macro conditions\", \"text\": \"Monitor monetary policy expectations and risk-on sentiment to assess sustainability.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Set tactical price levels\", \"text\": \"Use resistance and support (e.g., $125K resistance) to plan entries and stops.\" } ]} When could inflows trigger a sustained breakout? A sustained breakout is more likely if ETF inflows remain consistently positive week-over-week and price breaks and holds above the $125,000 resistance on strong volume. Confirmation would include shrinking exchange reserves and expanding derivatives open interest in the same direction. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Bitcoin ETFs net in the first week of October? Bitcoin ETFs netted approximately $3.24 billion in the first week of October, including a near $1 billion daily inflow on Friday that reversed a prior $900 million outflow. Will ETF inflows guarantee a price rally to new highs? ETF inflows increase the probability of price appreciation but do not guarantee new highs; market confirmation requires sustained flows, healthy volume, and supportive macro conditions like an easing Fed. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much did Bitcoin ETFs net in the first week of October?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Bitcoin ETFs netted about $3.24 billion in the first week of October, including a roughly $1 billion single-day inflow that reversed the previous week's outflows.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Do ETF inflows mean Bitcoin will hit new all-time highs?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"ETF inflows increase upward pressure on price and can support a rally, but a new all-time high requires sustained capital, volume confirmation, and supportive macro conditions.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways Immediate impact : $3.24B weekly inflow pushed BTC near $124,000 and set $125,000 as near-term resistance. Institutional signal : Large daily inflows indicate renewed allocation from wealth managers and advisors. Watch points : Sustained ETF inflows, exchange reserves, and Fed policy expectations will determine if the rally continues. Conclusion Bitcoin ETF inflows of roughly $3.24 billion in early October reflect a notable return of institutional demand, elevating BTC toward the $125,000 resistance. Analysts from JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Citigroup have revised targets higher, reinforcing a cautious but constructive outlook. Investors should monitor flows, on-chain metrics, and macro signals for confirmation before adjusting allocations.

      "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

      "body": "A recent surge in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows has pushed the price of Bitcoin closer to its last known all-time high as institutions start off October with intense buying ahead of what the general timeline is predicting will be an up only month. The increased Bitcoin ETF inflows, as the U.S. government remains shut down , have led analysts to note the diversion of funds into safe-haven alternatives like Bitcoin and gold, with the latter setting all-time high prices during the week. Bitcoin ETF inflows reach 2025 high According to data from SosoValue , Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.24 billion in net inflows this week. It is their largest weekly inflow since the year began and is also their second-largest weekly haul since they launched last year. Bitcoin ETFs posted their strongest week in 2025 in the first week of the U.S. government’s shutdown. Source: SoSoValue The Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.24 billion in weekly inflows between Monday and Friday this week, with Friday’s net inflow of $985 million being the second-largest daily inflow, second only to the $987 million they poured in on January 6. This reversed the $902 million outflow from the previous week and pushed four-week inflows close to $4 billion. The record Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly inflows are also happening alongside the rally in BTC’s price that kicked off the month. The price is already up over 10% this month, living up to the “Uptober” hype based on the fact that October is BTC’s second-best-performing month based on historical data. Year-to-date, Bitcoin ETFs have drawn in $23 billion of the $58 billion in total net inflows since their inception, a factor analysts claim is proof of growing institutional adoption. Aside from the increased inflow, the market also seems to be pricing in another potential Fed rate cut. BTC shines as U.S. government shutdown continues The increased ETF inflows may have triggered another rally in BTC’s price; however, the U.S. government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, may sustain the trend for the rest of the month. The political uncertainty that led to the government shutdown has also coincided with dollar price turbulence and talk of a capital flight as investors rush to hedge against the fall with BTC and precious metals. Observers are now predicting a month-long rally, including JPMorgan analysts, calling out the “debasement trades,” as investors continue to move to BTC and gold to hedge against inflation and macro uncertainties, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown . Prediction marketplace Polymarket has suggested there is over a 60% chance that the shutdown will last 10–29 days, during which BTC will really have a chance to shine as a store of value and hedge against inflation. On Kalshi, the current forecast implies the stoppage will last 11.1 days, up sharply in recent days as there has been no progress in negotiations happening on Capitol Hill. The shutdown formally started early Wednesday morning following a deadlock between top Democrats and Republicans, including President Donald Trump, on a short-term deal to keep the government funded. Government shutdowns usually last about 14 days, based on data from Bank of America going back to 1990. The S&P 500 has averaged a 1% increase during these events, but a prolonged closure this time could affect the already fragile markets. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to data from Dexscreener, wallet address 0x872a spent $3,060 worth of BNB to buy 16.86 million tokens of $4, a newly launched meme token trading on PancakeSwap. As the token skyrocketed in value, the trader strategically sold 5.12 million $4 tokens for 110 BNB, equivalent to about $118,700 at current prices. Even after taking profits, the trader still holds 11.75 million $4 tokens, valued at roughly $1.88 million, bringing the total profit to an estimated $2 million, a staggering 652x return on the initial investment.

      "body": "Slowmist’s MistTrack’s Stolen Funds Analysis shows that private key leaks remain the most common cause of crypto theft. The findings indicate that 317 stolen fund reports were filed between July and September, with assets worth more than $3.73 million successfully frozen or recovered in ten of those cases. Private Keys Remain the Core Vulnerability The report highlights that most crypto thefts rely on compromised credentials rather than sophisticated attacks. It notes that unauthorized dealers continue to sell fake hardware wallets, which remain a common scam. These devices often contain pre-written seed phrases or have been tampered with to secretly capture recovery information, allowing attackers to access funds once victims deposit assets. SlowMist advised users to only purchase hardware wallets through authorized vendors, create seed phrases on their device, and try tiny transfers before transferring large sums of money. Simple checks, such as verifying packaging integrity and avoiding pre-set recovery cards, can help prevent losses. Attackers are also developing new methods using phishing and social engineering. The report examined some occurrences of EIP-7702 delegate phishing, where compromised accounts were linked to contracts that automatically drained assets once a transfer was initiated. In such cases, victims believed they were engaging in regular activity, but hidden authorizations allowed hackers to gain control. The analysis shows that social engineering remains a persistent threat, with phishers posing as recruiters on LinkedIn and building trust with job candidates over several weeks before convincing them to install “camera drivers” or other malicious code. In one case, attackers paired the program with a manipulated Chrome extension during a Zoom call, leading to losses of more than $13 million. Old Phishing Scams Remain Effective Traditional methods also continued to prove effective. Fraudulent Google ads cloned legitimate services such as MistTrack, while spoofed dashboards for decentralized finance platforms like Aave generated over $1.2 million in losses through hidden authorization requests. The exploiters also hijacked unused Discord vanity links left in project folders to trick communities. Another attack vector disguises malicious commands as CAPTCHA verifications, tricking victims into copying code that steals wallet data, browser cookies, and private keys. SlowMist explained that Web3 exploits are not about complex tricks but involve hackers taking advantage of everyday actions. That being said, simple actions like slowing down, double-checking sources, and avoiding shortcuts are the best ways to stay safe in a space where threats keep changing.

      "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

      "body": "tariff distribution Bitcoin: Redirecting a $1,000–$2,000 tariff distribution into Bitcoin can act as a concise, inflation-resistant savings strategy. Bitcoin offers fractional ownership, wide liquidity, and a proven long-term return profile that has turned small stimulus allocations into substantial gains over multi‑year windows. Immediate hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often used as a store-of-value alternative to cash. Small allocations (e.g., $1,000–$2,000) buy fractional BTC and fit dollar-cost averaging strategies. Historical data: past U.S. stimulus rounds invested in crypto produced multi-hundred-percent gains for some investors. tariff distribution Bitcoin — Learn why investing a tariff check in Bitcoin can hedge inflation and capture growth. Read step-by-step guidance and key takeaways. What is a tariff distribution and how could Bitcoin benefit? tariff distribution Bitcoin refers to using tariff revenue to distribute cash payments to citizens. Investing that cash in Bitcoin can offer inflation protection, fractional exposure to a liquid global asset, and potential long-term capital appreciation compared with holding fiat. How would a $2,000 tariff distribution affect Bitcoin demand? A $2,000 distribution increases retail liquidity available for markets. Historical parallels: U.S. stimulus rounds in 2020–2021 saw an estimated portion of checks flow into stocks and crypto. A $1,200 stimulus invested in Bitcoin on April 11, 2020 (~$6,878 per BTC) would have harvested roughly 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 at a later valuation—illustrating how modest amounts can compound. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Why investing a tariff distribution in Bitcoin could make sense\", \"alternativeHeadline\": \"How a Trump-era tariff distribution might be invested into Bitcoin\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/images/coinotag-logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"An analysis of why directing tariff distribution payments into Bitcoin could be a practical hedge and investment strategy for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 payments.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/tariff-distribution-bitcoin\" }} Why consider Bitcoin for a tariff-inspired payout? Bitcoin offers scarcity (21 million supply cap), global liquidity, and fractional ownership, enabling even $1,000 purchases to meaningfully participate in long-term market moves. For many investors, those attributes make Bitcoin a practical option for preserving purchasing power and pursuing growth. How did past stimulus payments impact crypto markets? Past U.S. stimulus checks coincided with crypto rallies. According to reports at the time, up to an estimated $40 billion of stimulus funds flowed into stocks and crypto. Example: investing the initial $1,200 stimulus in April 2020 into Bitcoin (~$6,878) would have resulted in significant percentage gains over subsequent years. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to invest a tariff distribution into Bitcoin\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step guidance for allocating a $1,000–$2,000 tariff distribution into Bitcoin safely and strategically.\", \"totalTime\": \"PT30M\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Decide allocation\", \"text\": \"Choose a conservative percentage of the distribution to allocate to Bitcoin (for example 25%–50%).\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Select a wallet or exchange\", \"text\": \"Use a reputable custodial platform or a self-custody wallet to hold Bitcoin securely.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Purchase Bitcoin\", \"text\": \"Buy fractional Bitcoin using dollar-cost averaging or a lump-sum, depending on your risk profile.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review and secure\", \"text\": \"Transfer to cold storage if long-term holding; enable strong security measures such as two-factor authentication.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Should I put my tariff distribution into Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Putting all or part of a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can provide inflation resistance and growth potential, but it should match your risk tolerance and financial goals.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much BTC could a $2,000 payout buy?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"At current prices a $2,000 payout buys fractional Bitcoin (for example roughly 0.0165 BTC at a hypothetical price), enabling exposure without needing a full coin.\" } } ]} Should retirees or conservative savers use a tariff distribution to buy Bitcoin? Conservative savers should consider allocating a small portion of the distribution to Bitcoin while keeping emergency funds in cash and bonds. A modest allocation provides inflation exposure without overconcentration. Key Takeaways Small allocations can matter : Even $1,000–$2,000 buys fractional BTC with long-term upside potential. Historical precedent : Prior stimulus rounds saw material flows into crypto and stocks, producing significant gains for some holders. Security first : Use trusted custody solutions and best practices to protect holdings. Conclusion Redirecting a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can serve as a pragmatic hedge and growth tactic for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 checks. COINOTAG recommends weighing personal risk tolerance, using secure custody, and considering dollar-cost averaging to integrate cryptocurrency exposure responsibly. Published: 2025-10-04 — COINOTAG",

The analyst emphasized that this particular alignment has preceded major upward moves for XRP in the past—pointing to the last three instances on November 5, 2024, April 19, 2025, and June 27, 2025. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI. Here are the last 3 times we saw this happen pic.twitter.com/NzPHCMjvqS — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 4, 2025 Each of those historical signals coincided with significant bullish momentum, suggesting the current setup could mark the beginning of another leg higher. “We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for XRP at any point,” Cryptoinsightuk wrote, reinforcing that the chart structure remains technically constructive. Understanding the Technical Setup A bullish RSI crossover occurs when short-term momentum breaks above its longer-term trend line—an early indication that buying pressure is starting to dominate. When this signal appears on the three-day timeframe, it’s more significant than similar signals on shorter intervals because it indicates sustained market strength rather than short-term volatility. Coupled with the recent strong candle close, this crossover suggests that bulls are regaining control after a period of consolidation. Historically, such alignments on XRP’s chart have led to strong continuation rallies, provided they are confirmed by volume and price action in subsequent sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Resistance Levels and Market Context From a technical perspective, XRP faces its next resistance band between $3.20 and $3.65, a region that has repeatedly capped price advances in 2025. A decisive breakout and sustained close above that zone could unlock further upside momentum , potentially validating the “pop” scenario that traders like Cryptoinsightuk anticipate. Broader market conditions also favor bullish sentiment. Bitcoin remains strong above six-figure levels, overall liquidity has improved across digital assets, and institutional participation in on-chain settlement projects continues to grow. These factors collectively create an environment in which XRP could benefit from renewed investor confidence. Risk and Confirmation While optimism is building, analysts caution that no technical indicator guarantees results. RSI crossovers can produce false signals if volume fails to confirm or if sudden macro news shifts sentiment. Traders are advised to manage risk carefully, watch for volume-supported breakouts, and avoid over-leveraging positions during volatility spikes. The Bottom Line With momentum indicators in sync and historical patterns resurfacing, XRP seems poised for a potential breakout. As Cryptoinsightuk highlights, the market is once again positioned where a strong upward move could emerge at any time. Whether that surge materializes will depend on confirmation in the coming days—but for now, XRP sits squarely in what analysts call breakout territory .

      "body": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) said in his final interview from prison that handing over control of the company to current CEO John J. Ray III in November 2022 was his “biggest mistake.” Bankman-Fried stated that the decision “destroyed the exchange’s chance to save it.” Bankman-Fried's statements garnered attention during the investigation following FTX's collapse, during which the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell received more than $171 million in fees. SBF maintains its innocence: “I didn't defraud anyone,” it says. However, the jury's verdict confirmed that FTX's collapse was one of the largest financial crimes in history. Serving a 25-year prison sentence as of 2025, Bankman-Fried didn't abandon her habits even while criticizing prison rules in an interview: “We're only allowed to wear overalls from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. I don't know who made such a pointless rule,” she said, humorously describing prison conditions. SBF's parents, Stanford University law professor Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are on their son's defense team and are preparing to appeal the conviction. “I'm outraged to think of Sam sitting in prison; everything he could have contributed to the world has been destroyed,” Fried said. The family alleges that Sullivan & Cromwell was primarily responsible for FTX's bankruptcy. The law firm allegedly took control of the company from SBF, appointed John J. Ray III as CEO, and profited significantly from the bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried's team argues that this accelerated FTX's collapse. Related News: Donald Trump's Altcoin WLFI Announces Major Token Sale John J. Ray III, however, says SBF is “deceiving itself.” According to Ray, during the Bankman-Fried era, FTX was a veritable “house of cards,” and he and Sullivan & Cromwell managed to save thousands of customers money. FTX's 2022 collapse began with a financial report published by Coindesk. According to the leak, SBF's proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research, relied heavily on FTX's own token, FTT. This eroded investor confidence, leading to massive withdrawals and eventual bankruptcy. *This is not investment advice.

      "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-and-samsung-alliance-deepens-direct-crypto/",
      "body": "Consumer electronics giant Samsung has broadened its partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase , enabling Galaxy smartphone users to purchase crypto directly to their wallets. Coinbase Integrates Samsung Pay On Platform On Friday, October 3, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced the expansion of its partnership with Samsung. This renewed collaboration will grant Galaxy smartphone users in the United States direct access to crypto through its Coinbase One program. According to the exchange’s website, Coinbase One is a membership program for crypto users, offering zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, priority support, exclusive partner deals, and account protection for lost fund restoration due to unauthorized third-party access. Additionally, this partnership expansion includes the integration of Samsung Pay on the crypto trading platform. The announcement revealed that this will allow Samsung Galaxy smartphone users to interact with cryptocurrencies and other blockchain services. Coinbase’s Chief Business Officer Shan Aggarwal said in a statement: Together with Samsung, we’re pairing their global scale with Coinbase’s trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto — starting with more than 75 million of Galaxy users across the U.S., and soon around the world. The growing partnership between Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, and Samsung is a hallmark sign of the ongoing shift in the US crypto landscape. Following the election of President Donald Trump in November 2024, the improved regulatory clarity has afforded crypto companies the freedom to push for further expansion. Coinbase Revenue To Improve In Q3 2025? The improving crypto climate in the US has not particularly translated to increased revenue growth for Coinbase. According to the shareholder report released in August, the crypto exchange recorded a revenue growth of just 3% in the year’s second quarter, its lowest in recent years. These revenue growth numbers were not only low by the company’s standards but also lagged behind industry performance. For instance, Kraken registered an 18% jump in crypto revenues, while Robinhood posted almost a 100% increase. Investors will be looking forward to the revenue report of the recently concluded third quarter, as it is likely to impact the crypto company’s shares. Coinbase shares (with the ticker COIN) witnessed a sharp drop in value following the release of the second-quarter revenue report. As of this writing, COIN is trading at around 380.02, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to recent market data, the stock’s value has increased by more than 53% year-to-date.",

      "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp/",
      "body": "An alarming pattern of XRP whale activity has been noted, posing several questions about the sustainability of the cryptocurrency’s growth. Among the multiple questions currently being asked, one is more demanding of an immediate response: Is an XRP whale sell-off on its way? XRP Supply Surges Across Major Exchanges In an October 3rd post on the social media platform X, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted a recent shift in the behavior of XRP’s largest holders, the whales. The online pundit’s report was based on the Exchange Supply Ratio indicator, which tracks the proportion of XRP tokens on exchanges relative to its total circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Exchange Inflows Hit $5.7B: Profit-Taking Already Underway? This metric can be used to derive insights on potential selling pressure for a crypto asset (XRP, in this case), seeing as higher values would suggest increased availability of tokens on the exchange for sale. According to CryptoOnchain, there has been a spike in XRP supply across major exchanges, suggesting that whales might be positioning for a significant sell-off. The data shared reflects the increase in selling pressure across these exchanges, including Bithumb, Bitget, Bitfinex, and Binance, putting the XRP price at an increased risk of a sharp correction. XRP Displays Bearish Divergence As Sellers Dominate Futures Market In a separate post made on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain also revealed a budding negative divergence across the XRP futures market. The relevant indicator here is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which monitors the balance between aggressive buy and sell orders in the futures market. This metric is typically used to assess whether buyers or sellers are dominating the market in the short term. The analyst noted that while the price of XRP has been mostly around $3 after its recent rise, the ‘Taker Ratio’ across exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since November 2024. Interestingly, data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, further supports this bearish signal, as patterns similar to those seen on other exchanges have also been surfacing. Related Reading: Ethereum Matches Bitcoin In Annual Gains: What This Means For The Market CryptoOnchain explained that this situation could either mean that the market participants are booking profits or anticipating a price decline in the near future. However, the spike in XRP supply across major crypto exchanges, alongside the clear dominance of sellers in the perpetual futures market, strongly suggests the imminence of a price correction. It is therefore advisable to watch the psychological $3 level closely before market decisions are made. As of this writing, XRP is hovering around the $3 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

      "body": "Many investors are currently viewing bitcoin through an end-of-cycle lens, suggesting that Q4 could mark the close of the current market cycle. However, two key metrics point to the possibility that the bull market may actually be in its early stages. Glassnode data shows that the 200-week moving average (200WMA), which smooths bitcoin’s price over a long-term horizon and has historically only trended upwards, has just breached $53,000. Meanwhile, the realized price , the average price at which all bitcoin in circulation last moved onchain, has just risen above the 200-WMA at $54,000. Looking back at previous cycles, we see a consistent pattern. In bull markets, the realized price tends to stay above the 200-WMA, while in bear markets, the opposite occurs. For example, in the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, the realized price steadily climbed higher and widened its gap above the 200-WMA, before eventually collapsing below it and signaling the start of the bear markets. While, during the downturn of 2022, the realized price fell below the 200-WMA, it has only recently moved above it. Historically, once the realized price remains above this long-term moving average, bitcoin has tended to push higher as the bull market progresses.",

      "body": "Bitcoin continues to draw global attention as analysts keep projecting new highs before the end of the year. With institutional accumulation and retail adoption increasing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is still set for further growth. Forecasts indicate that Bitcoin could soon clear resistance zones last seen in August, which is promising for the entire crypto sector. Yet, even while Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, investors are tapping the market for opportunities with a higher return potential. This search has pushed MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already gaining momentum. With the speculation of a listing price of $0.007, community-driven growth has led to talk of bringing 100x ROI in less than a year. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong at $122K and Technical Indicators Bitcoin has risen by 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $122,300 at press time. This extends a 12% weekly gain. The move outperformed the market-wide 1.9% rise by the overall crypto sector, cementing this coin’s status as a trendsetter. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutional activity continues to gain ground for Bitcoin’s case. Public miners Marathon Digital and CleanSpark increased their treasuries in September. CleanSpark added 184 BTC, and Marathon increased reserves to 52,850 BTC, worth $6.4 billion. Disposal by both firms featured minimal sales and an emphasis on accumulation. By this strategy, the circulating supply is reduced, signaling confidence in a long-term value. Marathon’s expansion into AI and data infrastructure offers resilience to its operations. With several sources of revenue, the company does not heavily rely on the liquidation of BTC. Such institutional positioning gives credence to Bitcoin as a store of value. Retail adoption is another driver. Walmart-backed fintech OnePay announced plans to integrate Bitcoin trading to its mobile app by late 2025. With access to Walmart’s 150 million weekly customers, Bitcoin could have new use cases in retail payments. Enabling crypto-to-fiat conversions at checkout facilitates a payment bridge like Cash App’s, which historically led to increased transaction-driven adoption. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin has regained the $120K, moving above its 7-day SMA & 30-day EMA. The MACD histogram exploded to +688, its strongest signal since August highs. RSI is at 66.48, which indicates there is still momentum before overbought conditions develop. Analysts are targeting Fibonacci extensions at $124,451 and then $128,733 as the next resistance levels. Sustained closes above $122K may clear the path to retesting August’s record high near $125K. MAGACOIN FINANCE Forecast to Deliver 100x ROI by Next Year While Bitcoin’s climb reinforces its role as the market’s anchor, investors are increasingly turning their attention to opportunities with higher upside. That search has brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. Trading at a low price, the project is being hailed as one of 2025’s most promising tokens, with forecasts projecting a staggering 100x return by next year. The contrast is clear. Bitcoin offers stability and institutional adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to those seeking exponential growth. Speculation around a potential exchange listing has only amplified the excitement, suggesting that early participants could benefit from a surge in liquidity and demand once trading begins. Community momentum adds another dimension. Investor groups across Telegram and X have been buzzing with updates and coordinated buying strategies, echoing the grassroots energy that has fueled past breakout tokens. For many retail participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of l ow-cost, high-reward opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its early years. As Bitcoin tests resistance near $125K, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own narrative, one centered on accessibility and the possibility of turning small allocations into transformative gains within the next cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its strength as a dominant market force. With institutional miners accumulating, retail adoption expanding, and bullish technical indicators, the coin remains well-positioned for growth. However, the upside is moderated by its large market cap, making exponential returns less likely compared to smaller tokens. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With a forecasted $0.007 listing price and strong community engagement, it presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns. For investors balancing stability and growth potential, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive trajectory may shape one of the most compelling strategies of 2025.

      "body": "Tokenized stocks magnify risk for crypto treasury companies by layering onchain volatility and smart-contract exposure on top of traditional equity risks. Tokenized DAT companies face 24/7 price swings, settlement complexity, and code/hack vulnerabilities that can quickly impact both token holders and ordinary shareholders. Immediate risk: 24/7 onchain trading can trigger rapid runs on tokenized treasury shares. Smart contract exploits and custody failures can affect both tokenized shares and the treasury’s crypto reserves. Tokenized stocks reached over $1.3 billion in value, highlighting growing exposure (source: RWA.XYZ). Meta description: Tokenized stocks risks rise for crypto treasuries—understand tokenized DAT company exposure and mitigation steps. Read expert analysis and key takeaways. Crypto treasury companies are already capitalizing on highly volatile digital assets, and tokenizing company shares introduces new risks. What are tokenized stocks risks for crypto treasury companies? Tokenized stocks risks include amplified market volatility, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainty. Tokenized DAT companies that issue blockchain-based shares expose investors to both the treasury’s crypto exposure and the complexities of equity governance, increasing systemic and investor-level risk. How do tokenized DAT companies increase investor and corporate risk? Tokenized DAT companies create layered exposure: investors are exposed to the treasury’s crypto holdings and to the tokenized equity’s legal and governance complexity. Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo, notes that blockchains trade 24/7 while traditional markets do not, enabling price moves outside normal trading hours. Sharp onchain price movements that occur during off-hours can trigger liquidity runs. That risk is heightened when a company issues both traditional shares and tokenized equivalents and cannot respond in time to rapid price shocks. Tokenized stocks have crossed $1.3 billion in value. Source: RWA.XYZ What technical and governance vulnerabilities matter most? Smart contract bugs, custody hacks, and oracle manipulation directly threaten tokenized share value and the treasury’s underlying assets. Kanny Lee, CEO of SecondSwap, warns that tokenizing DAT equity “creates a synthetic on top of a synthetic,” exposing investors twice: to crypto volatility and to securities complexity. Regulatory ambiguity increases legal risk. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring blockchain-based stock trading, and traditional exchanges such as Nasdaq and NYSE are considering extended hours to compete with crypto markets. That policy evolution may change compliance demands for tokenized offerings. How can investors and companies mitigate tokenization risk? Adopt layered risk controls: comprehensive smart-contract audits, robust custody (multi-signature and cold storage), and clear corporate governance for tokenized shares. Require independent smart-contract audits and public audit reports. Maintain segregated custody reserves for tokenized assets versus operating crypto holdings. Implement circuit breakers and settlement limits for token trading during off-hours. Disclose legal status and investor rights clearly in token terms. How does round-the-clock trading change market dynamics? 24/7 onchain trading reduces market friction but increases the probability of sudden, large price moves. Nasdaq has announced plans to expand trading hours, and SEC discussions on tokenized stocks point to a potential future of extended market accessibility. These changes demand faster corporate responses and clearer disclosure frameworks. Nasdaq president Tal Cohen announces the push for 24 hour stock trading.

Smart contract exploits can freeze tokens, drain funds, or alter token rules. Token holders may lose value if contracts are not audited and if custody practices are weak. Will regulators allow 24/7 tokenized stock trading? Regulatory frameworks are evolving. The US SEC has discussed tokenized stock models publicly, and exchanges are testing extended hours, but clear, enforceable rules for 24/7 token trading are still under development. Key Takeaways Layered exposure : Tokenized DAT companies expose investors to both crypto volatility and equity complexity. Technical risk : Smart-contract and custody failures are primary attack vectors for tokenized shares. Mitigation : Audits, segregated custody, circuit breakers, and clear disclosures reduce systemic risk. Conclusion Tokenized stocks risks present a new frontier for corporate treasuries and investors. The blend of onchain trading, software risk, and regulatory uncertainty demands stronger governance and technical safeguards.

      "body": "Key Takeaways : The Celestia price prediction for 2025 suggests a maximum price of $21.22. By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $1 and $1.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.325, resulting in a correction to $1.106. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1.5 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction October 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment.

      "body": "As the fourth quarter of 2025 begins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is seeing a new wave of momentum courtesy of increasing speculation and token burns. But while Shiba Inu relies on hype, real buzz surrounds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-oriented DeFi token that most analysts are now saying is the top crypto to invest in. With its presale Stage 6 already over 55% sold, and backed by 16,750+ holders and $16.8 million+ raised, Mutuum Finance is being supported by its strong foundation of dual lending protocols, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial infrastructure. In a market tired of hype moving towards substance, Mutuum Finance stands to have upside leadership over SHIB in the subsequent market cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holds Key Rebound Level, Can Bulls Seize Control? Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at a very significant technical level of around $0.0000115, a level that has had a proven track record of holding firm as a good support in past market cycles. With exchange reserves at a near two-year low, pressure to sell appears to be easing, strengthening the argument for a potential rebound from here. If SHIB can sustain this level, an extended rally could ignite fresh momentum into Q4. A breakdown below support, however, may bring additional downside targets. While investors debate the next move for SHIB, there are also plenty of long-term players looking at prospects in emerging DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s generating increasingly higher degrees of interest ahead of the next bull cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Gains More Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees sharp progress in round six of presale as demand goes through the roof and the project raises over $16.8 million. Early investors are preparing themselves for potentially astronomical profits when the token is released for sale on the open market. Mutuum Finance is also creating new waves for a healthily flourishing DeFi ecosystem with the projected launch of a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In order to fulfill its promise of investor confidence and platform security, Mutuum Finance has signed up with CertiK to roll out a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The initiative is calling coders, white-hat hackers, and security researchers to participate to discover bugs rewarded in terms of severity ranging from low and minor to high and critical. The project is supporting community interaction with an early bird $100,000 giveaway , offering an extra motivation to join the presale. Mutuum Finance Prepares to Launch Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance publicly announced its preparations for launching its lending and borrowing protocol , an enormous development of its decentralized finance abilities. Scheduled for release on the Sepolia Testnet within V1 in Q4 2025, the protocol will introduce fundamental aspects such as liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and other key features. Supporting ETH and USDT initially for lending, borrowing, and collateral purposes, the platform is focused on a user-friendly and multi-purpose DeFi solution. Mutuum Finance protocol architecture is founded on close-order book topology, which will be reducing market risk and constraining illiquidity. Determining the primary parameters of liquidation levels, close-level conditions, and liquidator incentives is to make lending safe and stable. LTV and liquidation ratios are also calculated dynamically in relation to asset volatility, and riskier assets will be imposing more stringent lending terms. In addition to that, multipliers risk-weighted are employed across asset classes in a way as to maximize utmost aggregate resilience, security, and stability with varying market conditions. Shiba Inu’s Q4 confirms that hype is still alive, but for the investor looking at real utility and enormous potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) wins hands down. With the tokens still at just $0.035, over 55% of presale already sold in stage 6, $16.8 million raised, and 16,750+ early adopters onboard, MUTM is building a crushing DeFi platform that has nothing to do with hype. Its two lending protocols, addition of stablecoin, and advanced risk architecture place it with the potential to outperform SHIB, and become one of the top-performing cryptos of the next market cycle.

      "title": "OpenAI offers rights holders new controls in Sora",
      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-plans-sora-monetization/",
      "body": "OpenAI is moving quickly to turn Sora, its new AI video app, into a money-making machine after its debut this week on Apple’s App Store. The app lets users type prompts to generate short clips, and it has already filled timelines with animated characters, brand logos, and even political figures. Chief Executive Sam Altman said on Friday that the company will soon introduce ways for rights holders to control how their characters are used, while also testing revenue-sharing with those who allow their properties inside the app. Speaking in a video surrounded by Pokémon, Sam added bluntly, “I hope Nintendo doesn’t sue us.” The company acknowledged that users are generating far more clips than expected. Many of those videos, though, are for small audiences and include material protected under copyright law. That reality has lawyers warning that OpenAI could soon face major lawsuits. The app, still invite-only and available only on iOS, shot to the top of Apple’s download charts by Wednesday, just a day after launch. According to CNBC, users have already created videos with characters from SpongeBob SquarePants, Rick and Morty, South Park, and Despicable Me. Some showed Ronald McDonald escaping police in a burger car, while others depicted Patrick Star, Pikachu, Starbucks cups, and even The Simpsons. OpenAI offers rights holders new controls in Sora On his blog , Sam said two major changes are coming. The first is new tools for rights holders to give “more granular control over generation of characters.” This builds on the opt-in model for likeness already in place but goes further. Sam wrote that OpenAI is hearing from rights holders who see value in what he called “interactive fan fiction,” but those same owners also want to decide exactly how their characters can or cannot be used. He said the company plans to apply one standard to everyone while letting rights holders decide if they want in. “There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration,” Sam explained. He also pointed to Japan, noting the “remarkable creative output” from its users and how deep the connection is between fans and Japanese content. The second change will be monetization. Sam said OpenAI needs to “somehow make money for video generation” as usage has far exceeded expectations. He said the company will begin experimenting with revenue sharing for rights holders who allow their characters in user-generated videos. “The exact model will take some trial and error to figure out, but we plan to start very soon,” he wrote. Sam compared the pace of change in Sora to the early days of ChatGPT, promising rapid testing and quick fixes when mistakes are made. Varun Shetty, OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, said that the company would work with rights holders who want characters blocked from Sora. “We’ll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests,” Varun said. He also added that the demand for fan interaction is strong. “People are eager to engage with their family and friends through their own imaginations, as well as stories, characters, and worlds they love,” said Varun. Copyright experts warn OpenAI about lawsuits Legal experts are not impressed. Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, said that “a lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright.” He warned that OpenAI is “opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this.” Mark also emphasized that if a company loses control of its copyrighted characters, the fallout could be serious. “You can imagine why Taylor Swift wouldn’t want, even if pornography is off the table, wouldn’t want videos of her purporting to say things she doesn’t say,” he said. “I think the same is going to be true of cartoon characters.” The copyright pressure is already visible across the industry. Disney and Universal have filed lawsuits against Midjourney, accusing it of distributing AI-generated characters taken from their films. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI last week to stop it from using Disney characters without authorization. With Sora generating the same type of user content, OpenAI now sits on the frontline of a fresh legal storm. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

      "title": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making trips around the globe to seek funding",
      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openais-altman-seeks-international-funding/",
      "body": "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has embarked on a global supply-chain and fundraising campaign to boost his company’s computing capacity. Since late September, the OpenAI executive has sought alternative long-term low-cost supplies for his company’s multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. Altman is looking to the Middle East and East Asia to finance the accelerated build-out of his company’s infrastructure. He has so far visited South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan and has met with representatives from Foxconn, TSMC, SK Hynix, and Samsung. Altman previously claimed that his $850 billion OpenAI expansion plan is valid, as reported by Cryptopolitan. He acknowledged that people are worried about his company’s expansion, but emphasized that he is not backing down from the plans. The OpenAI boss said the biggest issue is not chips or money but power. Altman recently led a $500M funding round for fusion firm Helion Energy and helped fission startup Oklo go public through his SPAC. Altman plans to visit the UAE for more AI infrastructure and research funds The tech billionaire has planned a visit to the UAE, where he will meet investors. However, previous discussions are still in the early stages. Altman is encouraging these companies to increase production capacity and prioritize orders from OpenAI. Altman’s planned trip to the UAE echoes his 2024 effort to pitch a $7 trillion infrastructure plan to the same companies he hopes to get funds from in the region. However, some industry leaders dismissed his previous effort as unrealistic, given the limited revenue generated by AI services at the time. Shortly after the 2024 UAE trip, TSMC’s CEO, C.C. Wei, said that Altman was too aggressive, but now believes the OpenAI boss will garner more support this time. There is a renewed confidence in OpenAI following its deal with Nvidia, in which Nvidia agreed to invest up to $100 billion to lease 5 million AI chips over time to OpenAI. Altman has recently rubbed shoulders with tech leaders from Hitachi, and the announcement of their partnership has boosted the shares of both companies. During his Middle East stop, the OpenAI boss plans to meet with representatives from Abu Dhabi’s investment funds, Mubadala and MGX. He will also meet with representatives from operations partner G42, and the potential new capital will partly fund the Abu Dhabi Stargate data center. OpenAI sets aside $16B to rent computing servers Sam Altman pledged to spend roughly $16 billion this year and up to $400 billion by 2029 on renting computing servers. Altman claimed that the computing supply chain is facing manufacturing bottlenecks as his company seeks to meet growing global demand. Altman’s OpenAI has also partnered with South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung as memory chip suppliers. The ChatGPT maker plans to co-develop AI data centers in South Korea with both companies, as it projects a monthly demand of up to 900K wafers. OpenAI has a deal with the Japanese firm Hitachi to help develop its AI infrastructure and provide power transmission and distribution equipment to its data centers. The company will, in turn, provide Hitachi with its models and other technologies. “Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.” – Sam Altman , CEO at OpenAI OpenAI revived global enthusiasm this past week after releasing its video-generating model, Sora 2, on September 30. The AI firm also agreed with Nvidia to deploy at least 10 GW of Nvidia’s computing systems to train and run the next generation of OpenAI’s models. Last month, OpenAI announced five new data center sites across the U.S., which it plans to build in collaboration with Oracle and Japan’s SofBank. Samsung and SK Hynix also signed letters of intent earlier this week to supply OpenAI with memory chips for its data centers. Three years after launching ChatGPT, OpenAI is valued at $ 500 billion, on par with ExxonMobil and Netflix. The company will also be among the first to receive Nvidia’s Rubin system in H2 2026.

      "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

      "body": "Solana resistance around $230 is weakening because heavy profit-taking and clustered long liquidity between $200–$220 have absorbed buys; SOL’s short-term bid is fragile, with on-chain metrics (NRPL, realized losses) showing capitulation risk while $200 remains the critical support. Solana faces a weakening $230 resistance due to realized profits and low rotational flow. Key risk: $200–$220 long clusters could trigger a retest of $200 if bids fail to hold.

What is causing Solana’s $230 resistance to weaken? Solana resistance around $230 is weakening because large profit realization and a lack of rotational buying reduced bid support.

How could SOL move before the next leg up? SOL could retest $200 if the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed.

NRPL flipped red at the back end of September as price broke below $224, triggering roughly $1.7 billion in realized losses and accelerating sell-side pressure. Massive profit-taking followed the run-up: on 2 October, nearly $1.03 billion in SOL were realized around $234, meaning approximately 4.4 million SOL changed hands. The immediate reaction pushed SOL down to $228 (about -2.5%), showing the resistance wall at $230 struggled to absorb selling. On-chain distribution matters: around 5% of supply remains clustered at $224. With $200 million in overexposed longs concentrated in the $200–$220 range, the risk of a move toward $200 remains material if bids fail. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) The market is shrugging off rotational bids, and on-chain data shows investors avoiding altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index fell four points to 67 at press time, highlighting muted risk appetite and constrained alt flows. After capitulation, SOL bounced ~18.5% off $200, with bulls briefly turning $200 into support and testing $230. But resistance around $230 remains a near-term ceiling unless rotational buying and fresh bids return. Source: Glassnode Frequently Asked Questions Could SOL test $200 again this quarter? Yes. If $230 resistance holds and the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed, SOL could retest $200. A sustained reclaim of $200 by bulls is needed to resume a bullish trajectory toward $250–$300. What on-chain metrics signal capitulation? Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) flips, large realized-loss events (~$1.7 billion in this episode) and concentrated supply at specific price points (e.g., 5% at $224) are classic capitulation signals. Key Takeaways Resistance weakness : Heavy profit-taking near $234 weakened the $230 resistance and removed buying momentum. Support vulnerability : $200 is critical; $200–$220 long clusters ($200M) raise retest risk. Actionable insight : Traders should monitor NRPL, realized volumes, and order-book bids around $200 before adding exposure. Conclusion Solana resistance at $230 is under pressure as realized profits and concentrated long liquidity increase downside risk. Watch on-chain NRPL, realized-loss events and the $200–$220 long cluster for clues; if $200 holds, SOL could clear weak hands and target higher levels in Q4.

      "body": "A single podcast moment has sent ripples through both the political and crypto worlds. During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

      "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-meets-retail-walmart-linked-fintech-expands-into-digital-assets/",
      "body": "OnePay, the fintech linked to Walmart, plans to add crypto trading to its mobile banking app later in 2025, according to multiple reports. Sources told news outlets that users will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) inside the app, a move that would expand OnePay’s lineup of financial services beyond savings and cards. OnePay To Add Crypto Trading Reports have disclosed that the crypto functions will be powered through a tie-up with Zerohash, a firm that provides custody and settlement services for digital assets. That suggests OnePay will rely on outside infrastructure rather than build all systems itself. OnePay was launched in 2021 and is majority owned by Walmart, with early backing from Ribbit Capital, and the company has been steadily rolling out banking features since then. Partnerships And Product Plans OnePay is working with Synchrony to relaunch Walmart’s credit card offerings, and Reuters reported a Synchrony announcement dated June 9, 2025, about card programs set to return this fall. The app also aims to offer savings accounts and buy-now, pay-later options alongside the new crypto window. Users may be given the ability to convert crypto to fiat and then use those funds for purchases in Walmart stores or to pay card balances, though the exact mechanics have not been fully detailed by company spokespeople. How Much Will Users Get Access To At First? Several outlets suggest OnePay will start with the two largest tokens, BTC and ETH, rather than a long list of coins. Limits, fees and state availability were not disclosed in the reports, and those details could change before any public launch. Sources said the rollout is expected sometime later in 2025, with the credit card program arriving in fall 2025, but no firm launch date for crypto trading has been announced. Regulatory Hurdles And Timing Regulators at the state and federal level are actively watching crypto offerings from consumer apps, and compliance requirements could shape how quickly OnePay moves. Based On reports, the company has not publicly filed detailed disclosures tied to the crypto service, and both Walmart and OnePay declined to comment to reporters. That leaves open the possibility of a phased release, restricted to certain users or states at first. What This Means For Shoppers And Users If the plan proceeds, Walmart customers who already use OnePay could gain another way to access BTC and ETH without signing up for a separate crypto exchange. Analysts and users will be watching fees, protections for deposits, and whether the app allows spending crypto directly in stores or requires conversion first.

      "url": "https://timestabloid.com/20k-miners-sold-almost-420m-raised-heres-experts-place/",
      "body": "Crypto never stays still. This week, the spotlight spreads across three very different narratives: the WLFi (WLFI) app launch, Solana’s massive (SOL) whale move, and BlockDAG’s explosive presale momentum. WLFi is rolling out a retail app and debit card that ties its stablecoin USD1 to Apple Pay, promising to merge everyday payments with investing. Solana, meanwhile, is caught in the wake of an $836M whale transfer that could push price back to $200 before any rebound. Then there’s BlockDAG , the project that has raised nearly $420 million, shipped over 20,000 miners, and secured whale confidence with single buys of $4.4M and $3.6M. With Dashboard V4 giving presale participants transparency and DAG-based technology promising 15,000 TPS, BlockDAG is already viewed by many as the best crypto for 2025. WLFi App Launch Targets Payments And Investing At Korea Blockchain Week, co-founder Zak Folkman revealed details of the WLFi (WLFI) app launch, confirming it will connect USD1 stablecoin with Apple Pay. The goal is simple: make crypto payments seamless for everyday users. Folkman described the platform as “Venmo meets Robinhood,” combining peer-to-peer transfers with trading features. The WLFi (WLFI) app launch reflects a shift toward practical adoption rather than speculation. By staying blockchain-agnostic, WLFi avoids building its own chain and instead focuses on flexibility across networks. This design should expand compatibility, but it also means reliance on external infrastructure. If successful, it could bring stablecoins into mainstream finance. Solana Whale Move Signals Pressure The biggest market mover this week comes from a massive Solana (SOL) whale move, with over 2.5 million SOL worth $836M transferred to exchanges. Such inflows usually imply selling pressure, putting SOL’s $214–$220 support at risk. Technical signals back this cautious view: the DMI shows +D crossing below -D with ADX at 31, a pattern that has historically preceded sharp declines. Analysts now warn of a possible retest at $200 before any rebound toward $260–$270. At the same time, on-chain activity is weakening. Daily Active Addresses fell 27% in a week, undercutting confidence in long-term sustainability. Weighted sentiment has also turned negative, reflecting skepticism among traders. Still, derivatives show funding rates slightly positive, meaning some bulls remain committed. BlockDAG Explodes With Miners, Whales, & Breakthrough Tech While WLFi experiments with fintech tools and Solana contends with whale-driven volatility, BlockDAG is transforming momentum into measurable adoption, growing as the best crypto for 2025. The project has already raised almost $420 million in its presale, with coins priced at $0.0015 in Batch 30 and a confirmed $0.05 listing. This setup offers early participants a staggering 3,200% potential upside, a rarity in today’s market. Adoption is accelerating at scale. More than 20,000 X-Series miners have been shipped worldwide across 130+ countries, embedding Proof-of-Work security into everyday environments. Backing this physical expansion is deep-pocketed whale conviction. Single purchases of $4.4M and $3.6M have reshaped BlockDAG’s leaderboard, demonstrating strong market sentiment in the project’s long-term vision. On the software side, Dashboard V4 elevates the presale experience with exchange-style tools, including live charts, simulated order books, referral leaderboards, and gamified engagement. This focus on transparency and usability strengthens trust ahead of mainnet. At its technological core, BlockDAG employs a multi-parent DAG architecture capable of handling 2,000–15,000 transactions per second. By merging Proof-of-Work with Proof-of-Engagement, the network achieves both scalability and decentralization, addressing challenges that hinder many blockchain rivals. This trifecta of miner adoption, whale backing, and advanced technology places BlockDAG far beyond typical presale hype. Analysts increasingly argue that BlockDAG isn’t just another competitor but a proven project establishing itself as a frontrunner for the best crypto for 2025. Final Say! This week’s developments highlight how adoption, whales, and invention define crypto’s next wave. The WLFi (WLFI) app launch signals a push toward everyday usability, though execution against fintech competitors will be the test. The Solana (SOL) whale move reminds traders how quickly sentiment can shift under the weight of big transfers, leaving price action fragile but with potential for rebound. Then there’s BlockDAG, where a nearly $420 million presale, 20,000 miners shipped, whale buys, and DAG technology are all aligning into a credible growth story. For investors weighing the best crypto for 2025, the contrasts are clear. WLFi promises usability, Solana battles whale-induced volatility, and BlockDAG already delivers adoption and transparency. With its mix of miners, whales, and tech, BlockDAG looks less like a presale gamble and more like a long-term competitor ready to shine.

      "body": "Crypto analyst Bobby revealed that the XRP price has completed a consolidation pattern, hinting at a potential parabolic rally for the altcoin soon. The analyst suggested that XRP’s price could rally to double digits once this rally occurs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $19 As It Completes Double-Bottom Pattern In an X post, Bobby indicated that the XRP price has completed the macro double-bottom pattern, which it had spent over seven years building. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the altcoin is now gearing up for a rally to as high as $19 following the completion of this consolidation pattern. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces 25% Drawdown Risk, But This Technical Point Is Key Meanwhile, the analyst noted that the XRP price spent over nine months building support near the neckline of the massive W pattern. He added that the altcoin spent the same amount of time consolidating below the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of its latest macro swing high to swing low. Bobby indicated that the XRP price rally will begin once it breaks through $3.02 and gains monthly acceptance above that level. He expects this move to take XRP into the take-profit levels he has highlighted on several occasions. These levels include $4.7, $6.4, $7.4, and possibly $19, all of which mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the altcoin. The analyst also predicts that the XRP ETFs could spark a rally to between $8 and $13 with possible wicks into the $20 range. These funds are expected to launch this month, depending on when the U.S. government shutdown ends. They provided a bullish outlook for XRP due to the amount of inflows that they could drive into the altcoin’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bobby had also earlier alluded to previous cycles as the reason XRP could rally to $13. Analyst Sounds Warning To Bulls Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned XRP bulls that the XRP price needs to close above $3.13 to $3.20 on the 3-day chart to sustain the current bullish momentum. His warning followed XRP’s reclaim of the psychological $3 level, which he noted has wrecked the bears. However, the altcoin needs to close above this range, or the bulls are also in danger of getting wrecked. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could follow suit if Bitcoin and Ethereum get rejected on their current rallies. He added that the altcoin could head lower, which he believes might actually be better. He assured that the last impulsive move would be explosive and could lead to life-changing gains for the bulls. However, for now, he believes that XRP is simply ranging until it closes above $3.20. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

      "body": "As Solana (SOL) matures, the rapid short-term gains it once offered are becoming harder to replicate. The early-day investors who saw $200 turn into $5,000 have largely exited that window. Newer entrants in 2025 are looking at high-utility early-stage projects and still provide explosive upside. A crypto that already provides such an opportunity is Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a meme coin that has a real-life blockchain application. Having sold a record presale and increasing token price, Little Pepe is coming out as a top choice. Little Pepe: Ethereum Layer 2, Zero Tax, Staking, and DAO Governance Little Pepe is an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain with a combination of meme culture and real utility. The project features staking rewards, voting in the DAO, and launching memes, and zero taxation is applied to the trading. Future integrations are NFTs and cross-chain compatibility, expanding its possible application. The LILPEPE ecosystem will be designed to ensure that there is a balance between liquidity, reserves, staking, marketing and CEX preparedness with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. $26.3M raised so far: a clear presale trajectory Since launching its presale on June 10, Little Pepe has advanced through 13 stages, steadily increasing in value. Stage 1 began at $0.001, with subsequent stages climbing by $0.0001 per phase. By Stage 13, now active, the token price has reached $0.0022. To date, $26,382,101 has been raised out of a $28,775,000 target. A total of 16,162,317,775 tokens have already been sold from the 17,250,000,000 allocation. Stage 14 will introduce yet another uptick at $0.0023, which will be a 130% increase compared to the price of Stage 1. This continued flow has placed early investors near breakeven or gaining even before the presale ends, thus showing strong momentum and interest. $777,000 giveaway now live for presale contributors A $777,000 giveaway is currently live to celebrate the presale. Ten winners will receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. To enter, participants must contribute at least $100 to the ongoing presale. The promotion is active during presale stages only and also includes random big buyer rewards (15+ ETH) between Stages 12 and 17. Little Pepe presents a new investment window that mirrors the early Solana days. The project shows actual blockchain value with a fast-moving presale, the Layer 2 architecture, zero tax on trading, staking, governance of the project through DAOs, and future NFTs. According to the present momentum and tokenomics, LILPEPE has all the potential to become one of the most successful crypto assets in 2025.

      "title": "Million-dollar mark is possible for Bitcoin, Russian financier agrees",
      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-may-fulfil-durovs-1-million-prediction-by-2030-analyst-says/",
      "body": "Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, may be selling for much more than it currently is, only a few years from now. A recent forecast by a prominent figure in the crypto space that BTC is likely to hit $1 million has just been backed by professional stock trader. Million-dollar mark is possible for Bitcoin, Russian financier agrees The value of Bitcoin can reach, and even exceed $1 million by 2030, at the earliest, or sometime before 2035. That’s according to Russian financial analyst Oleg Reshetnikov. Reshetnikov, an expert on stock markets at BCS group, one of Russia’s oldest and largest providers of investment services, remarked that his assessment was still theoretical, but, nevertheless, based on stats. He was commenting on this week’s bullish prediction by Pavel Durov, founder and owner of the popular among crypto enthusiasts messenger Telegram. In an interview with American computer scientist and YouTube podcaster Lex Fridman, Durov revealed he bought Bitcoin early, admitting his BTC investments kept him afloat in challenging times. The Russian-born tech entrepreneur emphasized he didn’t care when BTC was falling and didn’t stop buying when it was up. He also stated: “I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” Durov suggested looking at the trends, especially with respect to “governments printing money like no tomorrow,” when Bitcoin has a predictable inflation that will eventually stop. Sharing his thoughts on the scenario outlined by Durov with the leading Russian online news website Gazeta.ru, Oleg Reshetnikov concurred: “One can indeed conclude that the price of Bitcoin, given its limited supply, could reach $1 million at some point, especially when compared to money printed by governments and subject to inflation.” Dogging the US for inflating the Greenback The Russian analyst gave an example with the United States, where money supply has grown almost fivefold since the year 2000, from $4.7 trillion to $21.9 trillion. Over the same period, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.5 times. According to Reshetnikov, for money to function as a means of payment, a 2.5-fold increase in the money supply, or even less, would have been sufficient. He is convinced there is a good reason to believe that money supply may continue its growth, whether linear or not. This will also be a factor determining how long it would take for Bitcoin to reach $1 million, the financial specialist noted, elaborating further: “In an ideal world, if the dollar’s purchasing power halves, the price of Bitcoin, whose supply is limited, should double. But in reality, this increase could be greater or lesser.” A lot will depend on how much investors believe in the cryptocurrency as a store of value and how much of their wealth they are willing to invest in it, Reshetnikov pondered in conclusion. BTC is currently trading at over $122,000, at the time of writing, after rebounding from a September low of below $109,000 per coin. In his conversation with Fridman, Pavel Durov was certain Bitcoin is here to stay, while he pointed out it’s yet to be seen if that will be the case with most fiat currencies that exist today. Attitudes regarding Bitcoin have been changing in his native Russia, where a business advisor to the Kremlin recently likened cryptocurrency to gold, stating it’s already just as stable. Durov left the country more than a decade ago. He did that under increased pressure from Russian authorities over refusing to censor content on his popular social media platform VK (Vkontakte), which had been effectively taken over by allies of the Putin administration. Last year, he found himself arrested in France, where he is still dealing with a legal case based on accusations of complicity with crimes allegedly enabled by his messaging app. Durov told Fridman he faced similar requests from the French government regarding Telegram channels during election campaigns in Romania and Moldova, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan.

      "body": "If you have $1,500 set aside for a high-potential crypto play, there is a fresh name that is catching the eye of early investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) built on Ethereum is not just another meme coin. It has already climbed more than 120% from its starting presale price and is currently offering about 36.36% projected gains before its public launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, having raised an impressive $26.37 million out of a $28.77 million target. A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

      "url": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/04/solana-is-the-new-wall-street-bitwise-cio-matt-hougan-explains",
      "body": "Solana’s role in the race to capture tokenized markets won new attention this week when Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan called it “the new Wall Street.” Speaking with Solana Labs’ Akshay Rajan on Oct. 2, Hougan said global financial leaders increasingly recognize the disruptive potential of stablecoins and tokenization. He noted that the heads of the SEC and Bank of England, along with BlackRock’s CEO, have all signaled that digital assets could reshape payments and securities markets. Hougan added that this narrative resonates strongly with investors who understand the scale of change such technologies could bring. Hougan said that once audiences begin to consider how to gain exposure to blockchain, comparisons between platforms inevitably follow. In that evaluation, he argued, Solana’s combination of speed, throughput and near-instant finality makes it “extraordinarily attractive.” He cited improvements from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds in settlement speed, describing the feature as intuitive for those accustomed to trading environments where execution and latency are critical. Framing Solana as “the new Wall Street,” Hougan said the blockchain’s technical edge is resonating with market participants. He said the narrative is “really resonant” and added that “you’ll see substantial flows.” Technical Analysis of SOL's Price Action According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session from Oct. 3 at 15:00 UTC to Oct. 4 at 14:00 UTC, SOL traded within a narrow $8.40 range between $228.19 and $237.04, reflecting a period of consolidation. The high was set at $237.04 around 16:00 on Oct. 3 before steady selling pressure pushed the price lower toward the $228–$229 area, which acted as support. Trading activity was strongest early in the session, with volumes peaking at 3.29 million units around 17:00, but gradually declined to just 42,637 by the closing hour of the analysis period. This sharp reduction in volume suggested weakening participation and a potential pause before a larger directional move. In the final 60 minutes, from 13:11 to 14:10 UTC on Oct. 4, SOL broke below the established $228–$229 support zone. Prices fell from $229.84 to $228.94, a 0.39% drop that confirmed the bearish shift. Within this window, the market showed two phases: an early rebound attempt that briefly lifted the price to $229.78 at 13:38, followed by renewed selling that drove the token down to $228.72. Importantly, this breakdown coincided with a surge in volume. The single busiest minute occurred at 14:01, when 18,011 units traded — the highest one-minute reading of the session. This pattern of falling price alongside rising volume suggested larger sellers were active, potentially increasing the likelihood that bearish momentum continues.

Bitcoin has climbed above $123,000 driven by increased institutional interest, macro uncertainty tied to a U.S. government shutdown, and momentum from ETF inflows. Market participants cite both fundamental demand and short-term liquidity dynamics as contributors to the rapid advance. How credible is JPMorgan’s $165,000 projection? JPMorgan analysts argue Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to gold and could reach near $165,000 by late 2025 driven by institutional allocation. This view rests on models comparing digital scarcity to gold and assumes steady inflows from large financial players. Why do some analysts call the move a “liquidity wave”? Alex Blume of Two Prime described the rally as a “liquidity wave,” suggesting short-term capital and trading flows may amplify prices without sustained retail or institutional demand. In this scenario, price action can retrace quickly if liquidity conditions shift. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret Bitcoin's Uptober rally\", \"description\": \"Steps for investors to evaluate whether the Uptober rally is sustainable or a temporary liquidity-driven move.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check institutional signals\", \"text\": \"Review reports and filings referencing institutional allocations and ETF flows for sustained demand indicators.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Monitor macro drivers\", \"text\": \"Assess macro events such as government shutdowns, currency weakness, and rate expectations that can increase crypto demand.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Evaluate on-chain metrics\", \"text\": \"Analyze on-chain data—exchange flows, large-wallet accumulation, and active addresses—to differentiate liquidity spikes from genuine accumulation.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Set risk management parameters\", \"text\": \"Define stop-loss levels and position sizing in case the rally proves transient; prepare for volatility when liquidity fades.\" } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Is Bitcoin’s rise above $123,000 a new bull market?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Not necessarily; the price rise may signal the start of a sustained bull run if institutional inflows continue, but it can also be a short-lived liquidity-driven spike.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What risks could stop Bitcoin’s momentum?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Key risks include a reversal in liquidity conditions, unfavorable regulatory actions, rapid interest-rate moves, or a sharp drop in ETF inflows.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How are altcoins responding to Bitcoin’s move?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Ethereum and many large-cap altcoins have rallied alongside Bitcoin; Ethereum rose roughly 9% to around $4,500 as of the latest trading session.\" } } ]} When might the rally become a sustainable bull run? For a sustainable bull market, Bitcoin prices must be supported by persistent demand across multiple channels: continued institutional allocations, steady retail participation, and improving on-chain adoption metrics. Confirmation typically requires price holding key support levels and consistent net inflows over several weeks. What does Ethereum’s move tell us about market breadth? Ethereum’s ~9% weekly gain to $4,500 indicates broader market participation beyond Bitcoin. Strong moves in large-cap altcoins often suggest increased risk appetite and can support the narrative that the rally has participation across crypto sectors. Frequently Asked Questions How high could Bitcoin go this year according to major banks? JPMorgan has a target scenario near $165,000 by year-end, based on relative value versus gold and expected institutional flows. These are analytical projections, not guaranteed outcomes. What should traders watch during Uptober? Monitor liquidity measures, ETF flows, macro headlines (e.g., government actions, rate expectations), and on-chain indicators to gauge whether gains are demand-driven or liquidity-driven. Key Takeaways Bitcoin moved above $123,000 : This level is the immediate pivot for bulls and bears. Institutional outlook is supportive : JPMorgan projects potential upside, reinforcing institutional narratives. Risks remain : Analysts warn some gains may be liquidity-driven; risk management is essential. Conclusion Bitcoin’s Uptober rally—pushing prices above $123,000—reflects a complex mix of institutional interest, macro uncertainty, and short-term liquidity dynamics. While projections such as JPMorgan’s $165,000 target add bullish context, caution from market experts reminds investors to weigh on-chain data and liquidity signals.

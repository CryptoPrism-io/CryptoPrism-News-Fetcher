      "title": "Economist Explains The Reality Behind XRP Price Reaching $100,000, It Can’t Overtake Bitcoin",
      "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-100000-bitcoin/",
      "body": "Economist and former forex analyst Moonchaser is explaining why expectations of the XRP price reaching $100,000 are not realistic. According to Moonchaser, many XRP fans misunderstand how market value works by claiming that XRP has no market cap. The economist highlighted that XRP, like any other asset or cryptocurrency, is affected by supply, demand, and liquidity. Economist Explains The Reality Behind Price Reaching $100,000 Moonchaser, who studied economics and previously worked as a forex analyst, says that some people in the XRP community believe the token can reach extreme prices because they think it has “no market cap.” This idea, Moonchaser explains, is built on a misunderstanding of how currencies are valued and traded in real-world markets. In their view, economic principles apply equally to all assets, whether they are fiat money, commodities, or digital tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin 3rd Cycle Explosion: Analyst Revels The Only Difference From Last Two Cycles Using the U.S. dollar as an example, Moonchaser notes that every currency has a measurable total value based on the amount in circulation and its global trade. The dollar’s value changes daily because of the balance between supply, demand, and liquidity. The same rule applies to the XRP price, which also trades across international markets and follows the same market laws. It means that XRP’s price is not free from limits and cannot simply rise endlessly based on belief or community hype. Moonchaser stresses that ignoring these realities creates unrealistic expectations within the XRP community. According to them, calling XRP a “currency” does not make it limitless in value; instead, XRP functions within the same market framework that governs all other financial assets. XRP Can’t Overtake Bitcoin Due To Market Structure In their post, Moonchaser further explains that market capitalization, which is price multiplied by circulating supply, applies to every form of tradable asset. Whether it’s fiat money, gold, or a digital coin, traders can always calculate the total market value. XRP is no exception to this rule. The economist points out that XRP has a measurable circulating supply and a price that moves through normal market discovery, where the balance between buyers and sellers directly determines its potential value, not wishful thinking. “Currency does not mean a capless asset,” Moonchaser says, reminding traders that every market has structure and limits. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin Price Could Still Hit A 600% Rally To Send It Above $1.5 Moonchaser emphasizes that their comments do not spread fear or negativity toward XRP. Instead, they want XRP investors to understand the realistic economic structure behind its price movement. XRP’s market position depends on measurable data, not speculation about infinite growth. The economist concludes that this is not FUD—it is simply market reality based on economics. Through this explanation, Moonchaser helps the XRP community see that price growth depends on genuine demand and market behavior, not dreams of capless value. While XRP continues to be an essential player in digital finance, the idea of it reaching $100,000 or surpassing Bitcoin remains far from economic reality.

      "body": "Deals in the crypto sector have accelerated this year as the crypto-friendly Trump administration has encouraged companies to expand their businesses in the United States. At this point, the latest news came from Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. Coinbase said today that it has acquired investment platform Echo in a cash-and-stock deal worth approximately $375 million and aims to bring fundraising tools to its platform. While the official statement came from Coinbase, Echo founder and online nickname Cobie, Jordan Fish, also confirmed the agreement on the social media platform X. Coinbase stated that the reason for investing in Echo was very simple and that by acquiring Echo, they wanted to create more accessible, efficient and transparent capital markets. Fish said Echo will remain a standalone platform under its existing branding for now, but he plans to integrate Echo's public token sale product, Sonar, into Coinbase. Coinbase explained that the deal will allow startups to secure custom-designed fundraising mechanisms tailored to their user bases and expand opportunities for investors to directly access early-stage projects. Coinbase also acquired a special NFT from Echo founder Jordan Fish for $25 million yesterday. Cobie had announced that if his “Up Only” NFT was purchased, he would resume his podcast, which he had paused since the FTX crash at the end of 2022. Coinbase has been attracting attention with its acquisitions this year. Its $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives exchange, has garnered considerable attention.

      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-com-enables-usdt-usdc-via-polkadot/",
      "body": "Crypto.com has enabled deposits and withdrawals of USDT and USDC via the Polkadot Asset Hub, it announced early Tuesday morning through the X social platform. The Singapore-based exchange confirmed users can now transact stablecoins directly through Polkadot’s Asset Hub, the specialized parachain for transferring non-native tokens and creating NFTs using smart contracts. According to Polkadot’s website insight, the Asset Hub is a Layer 1 bridge for non-native tokens and an experimental ground for decentralized asset management. Crypto.com activates stablecoin Asset Hub transactions post-migration The announcement comes exactly three weeks after Binance supported Polkadot and its sister network Kusama to migrate from Layer 0 metaprotocols to Asset Hubs. Developers of the protocols explained that the transition helps users manage their assets in the Polkadot ecosystem effectively by improving compatibility for token issuers and DeFi platforms. Deposits and withdrawals of USDT and USDC via Polkadot Asset Hub have just been enabled on the https://t.co/vCNztATkNg App. Launch the App 👉 https://t.co/JsWd2MG4O7 @Polkadot pic.twitter.com/5n60RuURjh — Crypto.com (@cryptocom) October 21, 2025 In the Polkadot Asset Hub, assets are categorized as either “sufficient” or “non-sufficient” to determine if an account needs a native token balance to hold certain assets. A non-sufficient asset can only exist in an account that already has a minimum native balance, referred to as the Existential Deposit (ED). The threshold for Polkadot is 0.01 DOT, while on the Kusama Asset Hub, it is 0.000003333 KSM, both ten times smaller than the EDs on their respective Relay Chains. Sending a non-sufficient asset requires the recipient account to meet the ED requirement. On the other side, sufficient assets do not require the account to have any balance of the native token. Polkadot has mentioned that the first sufficient assets available on its Asset Hub are USDC and USDT, identified by asset IDs 1337 and 1984, respectively. Other assets available include Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Ether (wETH), Kusama (KSM), alongside foreign assets transferred via cross-chain bridges Snowbridge and Polkadot Kusama bridge. Asset Hub users are being asked to verify the authenticity of tokens before making any transactions, as anyone can create and name assets on the Asset Hub using similar names and try to defraud them. Crypto.com integrates service in Brazilian retail trading platform At the end of the previous business week, Crypto.com completed its integration with SpiderTrader, a Brazilian trading platform catering to thousands of active retail traders. The integration has made SpiderTrader the exchange’s first fully integrated broker in Brazil, granting the latter company access to Crypto.com’s trading engine on the SpiderTrader interface. “This partnership with SpiderTrader marks an important step in our strategy to collaborate with regionally trusted platforms. Brazil and the wider LATAM region are vibrant markets for crypto adoption, and this integration allows us to better serve local users through trusted partnerships,” Karl Turner, Director at Crypto.com Exchange, said in a recent press briefing. Company activities continue in South Korea In other related news covered by Cryptopolitan, Crypto.com announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korean fintech company Travel Wallet. Travel Wallet, founded in the year 2017, has garnered more than eight million users and provides multi-currency wallets and global payment cards services in over 40 fiat currencies. Under the agreement, Travel Wallet will become Crypto.com’s preferred issuing partner in South Korea, which will see it launch a co-branded prepaid card for users to spend both fiat and crypto globally. The companies will also collaborate on integrating Crypto.com’s “crypto-as-a-service” (CaaS) technology into the Travel Wallet app to trade and hold virtual assets directly within the platform. Crypto.com also mentioned that the collaboration will jointly promote Travel Wallet’s KRW-denominated stablecoin in both ecosystems and improve cross-border payment efficiency through fast and low-cost transactions. “Travel Wallet will build a unified payment ecosystem encompassing foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. This move is set to significantly elevate the global competitiveness of Korea’s fintech industry,” said CEO of Travel Wallet Kim Hyung-woo. Still within the Asian jurisdiction, the crypto trading platform revealed it will participate in the upcoming APEC CEO Summit Korea 2025 as the event’s official partner. The summit will take place in Gyeongju from October 28 to 31, where executives, policymakers, and KOLs will meet to discuss digital innovation, artificial intelligence, and economic trends.

      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/u-s-banks-seek-collateral-argentina/",
      "body": "The cohort of banks, comprising Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, are experiencing challenges in assembling a $20 billion loan to Argentina without exposing themselves to the financially troubled South American nation. On Monday, Argentina’s central bank announced it had inked a $20 billion exchange rate stabilization deal with the U.S. Treasury Department. The deal brought the total amount of U.S. assistance for the third-largest economy in Latin America to $40 billion. Argentina’s central bank stated, “These operations will enable the Central Bank of the Argentinian Republic (BCRA) to broaden its range of monetary and exchange rate policy tools, including the liquidity of its foreign reserves.” U.S. banks stall Argentina’s $20 billion loan over collateral According to a WSJ report, the banks are looking for a pledge or guarantee to ensure they receive their money back. The report confirmed that bankers are awaiting word from the Treasury Department over what collateral Argentina can offer them or whether Washington intends to support the facility independently. In the report, analysts said that the banks cannot take action without Washington’s support. They claimed the Treasury has been overseeing the larger package, even though banks typically set up these kinds of rescue facilities on their own. The analysts argued that if the banks’ collateral question is not answered, the lending facility, which hasn’t been formalized, might not come together. A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said, “discussions on this facility remain ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more details when these talks are complete.” The report also revealed that U.S. banks haven’t been lending to Argentina and have been shut out of the international capital markets for years. Successive governments have borrowed dollars or printed money rather than cutting spending to narrow chronic budget gaps, leading to runaway inflation. The third-biggest economy in Latin America has missed nine sovereign debt payments, including three since 2000. The IMF has provided the Argentine government with more than 20 bailouts to close the gap since the 1950s. The bailouts include a facility that was agreed to earlier this year. U.S. Treasury intervenes to stabilize Argentina’s falling peso As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that the Treasury had “directly purchased Argentine pesos” as part of the program. Bessent stated that the peso’s decline and shrinking central bank foreign reserves have left the country in a “moment of acute illiquidity.” The Treasury secretary explained that the swap line would give Argentina immediate access to U.S. dollars in exchange for pesos. The Argentinian peso closed at a record low, down 1.7% on the day to end at 1,475 per dollar. Bessent admitted that the U.S. might suffer losses if the peso’s value declined during the swap period. The Treasury Secretary reassured policymakers that the USD-Peso exchange was being carried out via an Exchange Stabilization Fund under his direct supervision. Some nations, like Mexico, have pledged other assets to protect U.S. taxpayers in similar transactions. Brad Setser, the Whitney Shepardson senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), stated that the peso is steadily losing value. He added that the peso could continue to decline if the IMF compels the government to allow it to float and have its price determined by market forces freely. “The risks from these operations are unusually large. Should the peso depreciate, which many think is not only likely but necessary, the Treasury would be left holding assets that have fallen in value.” – Brad Setser , Whitney Shepardson, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Argentina’s currency is down 30% against the dollar this year. The currency depreciated further on Monday as Argentines braced for economic instability risks ahead of Sunday’s midterm elections.

      "body": "A series of approaching deadlines for XRP-related ETF applications has placed regulatory timing back into focus for digital asset observers. Coin Bureau shared a timetable showing when several asset managers are set to receive decisions or further action on their filings, presenting a clustered window that could carry broader implications for institutional accessibility to XRP. Key Dates for Major Applicants The schedule outlines a sequence beginning with Grayscale on October 18, followed by 21Shares on October 19, and Bitwise on October 20. Canary Capital is listed for October 23, WisdomTree for October 25, and Franklin Templeton on November 14. This succession of dates underscores how multiple firms are seeking to formalize XRP exposure through regulated investment products, concentrating attention on how the regulatory landscape may respond within a short timeframe. THIS WEEK COULD BE BIG! Will ETF approvals move the altcoin market? pic.twitter.com/K9Ynq4nx5r — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) October 19, 2025 Institutional Access and Regulatory Considerations The timing of these filings has prompted commentary around the potential impact of approvals, particularly in the context of broader market conditions and procedural constraints. One observer noted concerns regarding the disruption of government activity, suggesting that administrative delays could influence the outcome. Another pointed out that while ETF approvals may not drive immediate market surges, they play a significant role in shaping credibility. By offering structured, compliant investment vehicles, ETFs can increase confidence among institutional participants and create pathways for larger capital inflows over time . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What These Filings Represent While price speculation often surrounds ETF discussions, the underlying significance lies in formal market integration. Approval of such products would indicate recognition of XRP as an asset suitable for regulated markets, expanding its reach beyond retail access. Even if prices are not moved immediately, the presence of multiple prominent asset managers pursuing similar products signals sustained institutional interest. Each deadline will serve as a reference point for gauging regulatory posture and appetite for new digital asset offerings. Focus Shifts to Regulatory Outcomes With six distinct dates now clearly outlined, attention will turn to how decision-makers approach these applications. Whether approvals, delays, or requests for additional information are issued, each response will contribute to the broader narrative around digital asset legitimacy in traditional financial infrastructure. For observers, these developments are less about rapid price reaction and more about the long-term framework being built around institutional engagement with XRP.

      "url": "https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-trader-who-turned-2500-into-25000-in-2021-says-this-token-could-deliver-the-same-but-with-just-250/",
      "body": "A Ripple (XRP) trader changed $2,500 to $25,000 during the XRP rush of 2021, and now believes he has found another opportunity in the crypto space. Potential for similar gains. This opportunity comes with a significantly lower entry fee of $250. That opportunity comes in the form of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) meme coin, currently in presale. Many crypto investors consider meme coins a bad investment; however, the presale performance, promotions, and community surrounding Little Pepe provide a strong foundation for being the next big success, following the meme coin surges of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Why Little Pepe is Possibly the Best Opportunity in Crypto The price for stage 13 Little Pepe presale is $0.0022, and it moves to $0.0023 for the next stage. Although the price shift may seem minimal, demand for the project continues to grow. There is no question concerning the presale success, with 16.499 billion tokens sold and $27.124 million sold, showing how confident people are in the potential of the project. Like all presale-driven tokens, scarcity contributes to demand. As investors attempt to acquire tokens before they are listed on exchanges, they become more willing to purchase. This demand scarcity is seen in successful meme coins, resulting in extremely positive pricing after listing. As demand for Little Pepe builds, it is worth noting the community size, with the project reporting 44,000 holders and also 38,858 members on Telegram. The $777,000 giveaway, with 10 winners receiving $77,000 worth of tokens, generated 467,000 entries. The giveaway also contributes to demand. The combination of excitement from these initiatives is building momentum, expected to deliver outstanding gains when the token becomes available. Mega Giveaway and Community Incentives The community of Little Pepe is given even greater rewards. During the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway, the biggest buyers from Stages 12-17 will divide more than 15 ETH worth of Mega Giveaway prizes. This encourages prospective buyers to invest more, rewarding Little Pepe with even more initial capital, and helping the coin gain momentum. Anticipating the risks that come with new coins, the time to invest in Little Pepe is now, before it is available on the major exchanges. Listing Boosts Credibility Little Pepe has been listed on CoinMarketCap, which helps enhance its visibility in the competitive cryptocurrency industry. This is a positive credibility signal, indicating that Little Pepe is a legitimate and serious project. This received listing will comfort investors looking at Little Pepe for the first time. Top-Notch Security with Certik Audit One of the biggest concerns when investing in crypto is the security of the coins. Little Pepe took the initiative to guarantee the safety of investors by completing a Certik audit, achieving an impressive 95% score. Certik is a reputable entity in the blockchain world, recognized for its high-profile security audits and for providing security to projects such as Sui Protocol and The Sandbox. Such audits and security levels encapsulate the credibility of Little Pepe and the peace of mind of investors. The Potential for Major Gains With solid security measures, an active community, and impressive presale metrics, Little Pepe is likely to see considerable gains in value when it is officially listed on various trading platforms. If demand is sustained after the presale, early investors may enjoy substantial profits. For instance, the small presale investment of $250 is expected to yield thousands of dollars after the coin is listed and is gaining traction in the market. Conclusion: A $250 Investment and Life-Changing Returns Considering the price of $0.0022 per token, the presale is very attractive. Little Pepe is likely to deliver life-changing value to early investors, much like Ripple (XRP) did in 2021. Little Pepe, together with the community and credible support, is likely to gain as much traction as other meme coins; thus, meme coin investors will seek to achieve the same value as with Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With $250 presale investment, investors will gain the same Ripple value when Ripple customers exchanged $2,500 for $25,000 in 2021.

      "title": "How to Choose the Best Crypto Tax Software: 2025 Investor’s Guide",
      "url": "https://cryptopotato.com/best-crypto-tax-software-guide/",
      "body": "The crypto industry has undoubtedly become one of the go-to places for anyone seeking a profitable investment. Users put money into crypto assets, non-fungible tokens, memecoins, DeFi protocols, and basically any crypto product that can maximize their earnings. All these happen on various crypto platforms, exchanges, and wallets. But, wait! It is vital to consider the applicable taxes on these transactions across all platforms. Doing so manually can be time-consuming and exhausting. That’s where crypto tax software comes into the picture. The tax authorities in various countries mandate citizens to submit tax reports for their crypto transactions. This would especially be difficult for those who trade in the crypto market more often. To make the process as seamless and thorough as possible, we have curated a list of crypto tax software tools that you can choose from to fulfill your tax obligations with ease. We will also highlight how to choose the best crypto tax software. Main Takeaways: Crypto earnings are taxable, and failing to report them properly can lead to serious financial penalties under local regulations. The best crypto tax software can automate calculating your taxes and preparing ready-to-file reports. Choosing the right software is subjective and based on factors such as local tax regulations, your specific needs, transaction types, and more. Platforms are inherently different – from beginner-friendly UX/UI to more professional-grade and CPA-oriented solutions. Using a crypto tax app can save time and money, helping you stay compliant and meet deadlines. A Closer Look at Crypto Taxes Like most financial instruments, cryptocurrencies are subject to taxation in accordance with the regulations enforced by the tax authority in a country or specific region. Failure to do so often results in penalties, which add up yearly. How do you know when you’re to pay a crypto tax? Tax laws in most countries mandate that you pay taxes when you sell crypto or exchange crypto for any goods, services, or property. Some governments even impose taxes on mining, swapping, staking, and airdrops. They are often categorized under capital gain taxes and income taxes. For context, capital gain taxes in the crypto market refer to taxation on profits made from selling or swapping crypto at a profit. On the other hand, income taxes apply to taxation on income earned, such as staking, mining, wages, salaries, rent, interest, etc. Some governments have gone further to categorize crypto airdrops under gift taxes. While there is generally no taxation on crypto deposits and purchases, it is vital to keep a record of them, as this will help you create a streamlined tax report. At the end of every tax year, the tax authority requires every citizen to submit their tax reports and pay their levy. The tax year varies from country to country. For instance, the United States’ Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Canadian tax authority, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), start their tax year from January 1st. His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the United Kingdom’s tax authority, starts its fiscal year from April 6th. On the other hand, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) begins its tax year from July 1st. Hence, it is essential to know when the tax year commences in the country where you reside. Another important thing is to know what kind of crypto transactions are not taxable. We mentioned earlier that crypto deposits are not often subject to taxation. Aside from this, a user does not pay taxes when they incur a loss on their crypto portfolio. From time to time, a taxpayer may qualify for a tax rebate. As a result, it is necessary to deduct the necessary amount from the tax report. The fact is, compiling an accurate and comprehensive tax report is gruelling for anybody, especially those who frequently use crypto. That is why there is a need for a platform that can automate the entire process. What is Crypto Tax Software? Crypto tax software is an automated platform that helps taxpayers calculate and file taxes on their cryptocurrency activities. The platform tracks the crypto user’s purchases, sales, trading, staking, or earnings from NFTs. Instead of doing the math manually, these tools automatically collect your transactions from different wallets and crypto exchanges, and classify them correctly as either income tax, capital gain tax, or any other kind of tax. These platforms also calculate your gains and losses and generate accurate tax reports. They also help track your portfolio in real time. They often suggest ways to lower your taxable income through features like tax-loss harvesting. In short, they save you time, prevent costly mistakes, and help you fulfill your tax responsibilities during the crypto tax season.

How Did We Rank the Best Crypto Tax Software? To prepare the above list, we have used a combination of criteria we believe are paramount to choosing the best solution.

Crypto Tax Software Features to Look For Having discussed the best solutions out there, here is a breakdown of several things to look out for when choosing one to use: Geographical Location We mentioned earlier that tax laws vary from one country to another. What works in one region/country might not work in another. Hence, it is vital to look for a crypto tax software that adds support for the local tax regulations in your country of residence. Pricing Most crypto tax software tools offer their services at a stipulated price range. They offer advanced features to users who subscribe to higher pricing packages. It is essential to compare prices across platforms to make a cost-effective choice. Key Features Crypto tax software tools offer various features that attract users. Key features include crypto exchanges and wallet integration. Some of these features include support for transactions from DeFi, NFTs, trading, and staking, among others. There are also tools like the tax calculator. Before choosing a crypto tax software, ensure it supports the necessary features to enable you to fulfill your tax obligations accordingly. Availability of An Account Officer Although the software promises to cover the complexities of the account, it is quite relieving when you know that there are actual account officers to tend to your tax needs to ensure accuracy. Most crypto tax software platforms offer a personal account officer to users when they pay for specific pricing packages. These tax experts can provide real-time insights to make your tax reporting process as seamless as possible.

Tom Lee stated yesterday that Ethereum will enter a major “supercycle” period in the near future. The famous name also added that ETH's current price level offers an attractive investment opportunity. We Accelerated Ethereum (ETH) Purchases! Tom Lee first stated that there was a significant deleveraging event in the cryptocurrency market this month. Stating that this crash presented a buying opportunity, Lee said that his company, BitMine, accelerated its Ethereum purchases after the crash. BitMine purchased another $250 million worth of ETH from cryptocurrency exchanges Bitgo and Kraken on Monday, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence. At this point, Lee stated that the current price level offers an attractive buying opportunity, saying: Open interest for Ethereum is currently hovering around the levels seen on June 30th of this year. At that time, ETH was at $2,500. Given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, the current price differential presents an attractive risk/reward structure. Tom Lee also stated that if ETH/BTC breaks through the 0.087 resistance, he predicts ETH will reach $5,000 in the short term. As you may recall, Tom Lee, along with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, one of the important names in the market, recently stated that Ethereum will reach $10,000 within the year.

      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polkadot-price-prediction/",
      "body": "Key takeaways In 2025, Polkadot might reach a maximum price value of $4.92 and an average value of $4.58. In 2028, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $15.81 to a minimum of $13.00. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $48.15 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture, which ensures network security—and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on the Acala Network, which enhances functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility, contributing to its substantial market capitalization. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.121 Market Cap $6.79B Trading Volume $274.48M Circulating Supply 1.62B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.44 24-hour Low $3.09 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 4.80% 50-Day SMA $ 4.04 14-Day RSI 50.02 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 71(Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 4.13 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces bearish pressure amid a tight trading range DOT trades between $2.96 and $3.13, showing a tight battle between buyers and sellers. Market sentiment remains cautiously bearish, characterized by weak buying momentum and ongoing profit-taking. $2.96 acts as critical support, where holding above may spark a rebound, but a drop below could extend losses. Polkadot (DOT) trades at $2.97 on October 21, 2025, marking a 3.21% decline over the past 24 hours. The token experienced a narrow trading range, with a daily high of $3.13 acting as resistance and a low of $2.96 providing substantial support. Market sentiment shifted bearish, driven by moderate profit-taking and weaker momentum in altcoins. Despite the price pressure, Polkadot’s ecosystem remains active, with steady development progress and increased parachain activity keeping long-term investors attentive to the network’s underlying value. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT testing key support at $2.96 On the daily timeframe, Polkadot’s price trend has turned slightly bearish after multiple failed attempts to hold above the $3.10–$3.13 resistance area. Sellers have taken control near this zone, forcing the price back below the psychological $3.00 mark. The daily RSI indicates weakening bullish momentum, and the candlestick structure displays successive lower highs — a classic sign of short-term exhaustion among buyers. Volume data reinforces this view, as declining participation signals limited enthusiasm for upward continuation. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView The $2.96 support level now represents a crucial threshold for the market. A breakdown below this level could trigger further selling pressure toward the $2.85 zone, where historical accumulation has previously occurred. However, if DOT maintains its footing above $2.96, a relief rally toward $3.05–$3.10 could develop in the short term. The overall bias remains cautious, with traders watching for either a clean breakout above resistance or a decisive move below support to confirm the next directional leg. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT consolidation at lower range On the 4-hour chart, Polkadot continues to consolidate within a tight band between $2.96 and $3.00, suggesting market indecision. Candlestick formations reveal short-bodied patterns with reduced volume, reflecting a temporary pause in both buying and selling momentum. The price structure also highlights minor lower highs, indicating that bears still hold a slight advantage in the short term. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading near the $2.97 level, holding just above the key intraday support at $2.96. Maintaining this support could lead to a technical bounce toward the $3.02–$3.05 resistance zone, while a breakdown below $2.96 might extend the decline toward $2.90–$2.85. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is hovering around 41, suggesting further bearish pressure. However, the MACD shows limited momentum, and without a notable increase in trading volume, any recovery is likely to be modest. Overall, traders remain cautious as DOT consolidates within this narrow price range. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.03 SELL SMA 5 $4.16 SELL SMA 10 $4.23 SELL SMA 21 $4.12 SELL SMA 50 $4.07 SELL SMA 100 $4.00 SELL SMA 200 $4.11 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.11 SELL EMA 5 $4.06 SELL EMA 10 $4.00 SELL EMA 21 $3.96 BUY EMA 50 $3.94 BUY EMA 100 $4.00 SELL EMA 200 $4.30 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot’s near-term outlook remains cautious as the token continues to trade just above the critical $2.96 support level. If this zone holds firm, traders could see a modest rebound toward $3.05–$3.10, driven by short-covering and renewed buying interest at lower levels. However, if sellers push the price below $2.96, it could open the door to further downside pressure toward $2.85, where previous demand emerged. Market behavior suggests that DOT may stay range-bound until a decisive breakout occurs either above $3.13 or below $2.96. A sustained move beyond these limits will likely set the tone for the next trend. For now, traders are advised to closely monitor volume and price action, as any increase in buying strength near support could signal the beginning of a short-term recovery phase. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot remains a robust blockchain project, focusing on interoperability and scalability, supported by its active ecosystem of parachain. Despite short-term bearish momentum, its solid technology and ongoing development give it long-term potential. At around $2.96, DOT may offer an opportunity for long-term accumulation if support holds. However, a drop below this level could lead to deeper losses. For investors with a long-term outlook, Polkadot’s network fundamentals remain attractive, but caution is advised amid current market volatility. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot’s drop to $2.97 (down 3.21%) is attributed to broader market weakness and profit-taking across the altcoin market. Persistent resistance near $3.13 has triggered selling, while reduced volume shows cautious trader sentiment. With limited buying interest below $3.00, DOT remains under short-term pressure. The decline reflects general risk-off behavior in the crypto market, though support at $2.96 could help stabilize prices if demand returns. Recent news on Polkadot Grayscale has updated its S-1 registration filings with the SEC for two proposed cryptocurrency ETFs—one for Cardano (ADA) to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GADA and another for Polkadot (DOT) to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker DOT. Both funds would hold the underlying assets directly, track CoinDesk pricing indices, and use Coinbase Custody, mirroring the firm’s existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The filings update earlier 19b-4 applications from February 2025, though SEC approval remains pending, with the Cardano ETF decision now delayed to October 26. 🚨Polkadot ETF Update: Grayscale filed S-1 registration statements with the SEC to launch @Polkadot (DOT). One step closer to the official launch🔥 #Polkadot $DOT pic.twitter.com/TcrExuKqhG — Polkadot.ERI (Polkadot Ecology Research Institute) (@Polkadot_ERI) August 30, 2025 The amendments reflect Grayscale’s continued push amid a crowded field of 96 pending crypto ETF applications, including Solana, XRP, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Litecoin. Market optimism has risen regarding the expected price for the Cardano ETF. Polymarket data show approval odds for the Cardano ETF climbing to 87%, supported by Grayscale’s renewed efforts, strong ADA performance, and recent regulatory clarity around staking that could accelerate approvals across the sector. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2027, with expectations for next week also showing positive trends. Will Polkadot reach $40? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $40 by 2031. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years. However, you are advised to do your research before investing in the volatile market. Polkadot price prediction October 2025 Here are the current Polkadot price movements in October 2025.

      "BODY": "Traditional investment firms all have the same mantras: “time in the market beats timing,” “move slowly,” and “big money is in the waiting.” It’s an action plan that made sense 20 years ago, but today, it’s a sure strategy for getting steamrolled by forces most of these firms refuse to acknowledge. The uncomfortable truth is that markets no longer run on just earnings reports and balance sheets; they run on stories, memes, and cultural ideas that gain momentum through social communities like X and Reddit and move faster than analysts can reliably keep track of. As much as we want to call GameStop a glitch, it’s only a preview of how markets now work. Crypto investors had an outsized role in driving this shift that spilled over into traditional markets. And now, retail investors have evolved from spectators to active market movers and makers, armed with platforms that let them coordinate, analyze, and act upon market intelligence at scale and unprecedented speed. While not every retail investor can outpace professional analysts, the most plugged-in communities have shown they can collectively move faster than institutions still operating by outdated playbooks. Look at Reddit’s WallStreetBets users, who drove the 2021 GameStop rally that led to massive losses for short sellers, citing that retail traders were the real force behind the market upheaval. Investors who have learned to read the cultural signals and narratives alongside financial ones will stay ahead. Markets Don’t Crash From Speculation A Wall Street secret is that markets don’t crash because of meme stocks — they crash because of stubborn loyalty to yesterday’s winners. The historic Dot-com Bubble didn’t burst because traders shifted their attention, but because both institutional and retail investors were in denial about industry over-valuation. Instead of recognizing the underlying stories that showed early signs of tech stocks’ crumbling prices, they chose to put their trust in past performance. Crashes happen when conviction in positions hardens into blind faith and unquestioning belief, and markets force a hard reset. Speculation keeps markets honest by forcing constant reevaluation. Retail investors do this daily by actively debating a stock or token’s prospects or deep diving into company fundamentals with fellow market participants. When they engage critically and stress-test every narrative in real time, they perform an invaluable and increasingly rare service as the active asset management industry shrinks in favor of passive investing strategies. The smartest retail investors ride a stock or token’s momentum but pivot as soon as the story changes. Their willingness to be wrong and adapt quickly helps prevent the kind of slow-moving institutional groupthink that leads to massive corrections, while still acknowledging that even retail communities can fall into faster, more volatile herd behavior. This mix of flexibility and collective attention makes them a uniquely influential force in today’s markets. Retail Runs the Show - and It’s About Time Retail stock trading is up to 20-35% of volume in the U.S. and UK alone, while crypto trade volume has also surged this past month exceeding a total market cap of $4T , but the change they’re forcing isn’t numbers — it’s intelligence. They’re networked, fast, and often spot trends before your dad’s broker does. Communities on platforms like Reddit and Discord can collectively analyze news, filings, and earnings calls, surfacing insights that sometimes catch institutional investors off guard. During the AMC rally, coordinated attention from retail communities amplified price swings and forced institutional adjustments. Today, AI-driven tools and educational platforms are making retail investors more capable and informed than ever, allowing them to process data and sentiment in real time. They might not always be right, but they’re influential enough to matter. Taking a page out of what crypto has been doing for years, some companies are starting to get it: CEOs now engage directly with retail communities, and IR departments track social sentiment. They understand the passion retail investors have for their stocks and are more willing to stick with them through poor performance than with an institution that’s judged on quarterly performance. Fighting Speculation is Fighting Reality It’s 2025 and talking heads are still warning about how the gambling mentality is ruining price discovery, pointing to meme stocks and crypto volatility as proof that retail has turned markets into a casino floor. They say that embracing speculation encourages poor decision-making, market instability, and over-exposure to risk. This way of thinking misses that prices have always been driven by collective beliefs about future values. Now that more people are able to participate, it’s just happening faster. Crypto is the ultimate example. Early critics called it pure speculation, divorced from the fundamentals of market movements, but it was actually just genuine price discovery happening at warp speed. The crypto market tested more ideas in a few years than traditional VCs could explore in a decade. While some ideas were garbage, the winners were massive. How Do You Win in the New Game? Don’t throw the fundamentals out the window just yet — success involves a hybrid approach of solid analysis and narrative awareness. More often than not, a great company with a boring story will underperform a decent company with a compelling narrative. Success means knowing narratives can change quickly and taking positions that capitalize on that. By diversifying based on assets and stories, risk management is more comprehensive. It allows investors to stay plugged into the communities and platforms where market-moving conversations are happening, while being willing to admit being too certain about any position means you may be setting yourself up for a painful lesson in market dynamics. However, it’s also about being able to distinguish between market volatility and noise, and recognizing the distinction between legitimate analysis and the misinformation that can spread rapidly in these communities. Adapt or Get Left Behind Retail is here to stay — the technology exists and the communities keep growing. By acknowledging this is the new normal and learning to navigate social intelligence and narrative-driven momentum, all investors like will thrive. The future belongs to those who are flexible and can expand their toolkits beyond earnings reports and balance sheets to a world where information flows instantly and communities coordinate buying and selling in real time. Speculation lets investors read both the fundamentals and social sentiment to spot undervalued assets and emerging narratives before the crowds catch on. Read the signals and adapt, or watch from the sidelines.",

      "BODY": "Bitcoin (BTC) is continuing to chip away at a key level of resistance at $120,000 as it sets its sights on fresh record highs. Bearish traders are attempting to defend the area, increasing short positions, but this could fuel the fire and create an impetus to the upside, otherwise known as a short squeeze. The altcoin market is also performing well, grinding higher despite a relative lack of volatility compared to previous moves the the upside. Derivatives Positioning The BTC futures market remains strongly bullish, with open interest holding at all-time highs above $32 billion. The three-month annualized basis is also elevated, approaching 8%. A notable divergence exists, however, in funding rates. Deribit's rate is exceptionally high at 25%, while other exchanges like Bybit show more neutral funding, suggesting a potential concentration of aggressive long positions in specific areas. The BTC options market is showing a state of neutrality. The 24-hour put-call volume is still slightly call-dominated at 52.25%, but this is a decrease from previous days, indicating a potential moderation of bullish conviction. Concurrently, the 1-week 25 delta skew is now essentially flat at 0.33%, signaling a balanced implied volatility for both puts and calls. This combination of metrics suggests a market that is settling into a more balanced and hesitant phase after a period of stronger bullish sentiment. Coinglass data shows $380 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 35-65 split between longs and shorts. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $121,300 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise. Token Talk By Oliver Knight The crypto market continued to edge higher on Friday with the likes of ETH, SOL and XRP all rising by more than 2%, while smaller market cap tokens like ETHFI and CAKE rose by as much as 15% and 25%. The relative strength comes as bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit $120,000 on Thursday as it takes aim at record highs above $124,000. But unlike previous forays above $120,000, this move has been rather muted; with price remaining in a tight range as opposed to a spike in volatility. This bodes well for altcoins which typically perform well when bitcoin consolidates as it allows capital to rotate from bitcoin to more speculative bets. However, the upside shift has not been kind to a select few tokens, notably MYX Finance (MYX), which was dealt a grueling 43% decline due to a rapid unwind of leverag e. Plasma's XPL token, as reported in Thursday's Daybook, continues to stutter amid speculation around whether market makers are shorting on behalf of the founding team, a claim that XPL founders have denied.",

      "BODY": "Crypto traders were in a jubilant mood on Thursday morning as bitcoin zoomed above $119,000, setting its sights on a new record high. The altcoin market also heated up; tokens like monero (XMR) and aptos (APT) posted double-digit gains while zcash (ZEC) continued Wednesday's surge with a 58% move in the past 24 hours to $143. The catalyst for crypto's rise was a mixture of ETF inflows, gold's rise and general positive sentiment towards risk assets. Derivatives Positioning The BTC futures market is showing a strong and sustained bullish trend, with key metrics reaching new highs. Open interest has climbed to an all-time high of $32.6 billion, reflecting a significant increase in trader exposure, with Binance leading the way at $13.6 billion. This record-high interest is supported by a stable 3-month annualized basis, which has settled around 7%, indicating that the basis trade remains profitable and reinforcing the positive market sentiment. The combination of these two metrics suggests that recent price action is being driven by strong, conviction-based bullish positioning rather than short-term speculation. The BTC options market is presenting a complex and contradictory picture of sentiment. While the 25 Delta Skew for short-term options continues its downward trend, now at just 3.25%, suggesting that traders are willing to pay a premium for puts to hedge against downside risk, the 24-hour Put/Call Volume tells a different story. Calls are still dominating the volume at over 56%, indicating that a majority of traders are actively positioning for a rally rather than a decline. Meanwhile, BTC's funding rate on major exchanges is hovering between an annualized 9% to 10%, indicating healthy demand for leveraged long positions. However, a significant outlier is Deribit, where the funding rate has spiked dramatically to over 60%. This isolated but extreme spike suggests intense, concentrated demand for long positions on that platform, but the overall market, including altcoins, does not yet appear to be overheated with average funding for top 30 coins by market capitalization at around 10% annualized, as per Coinglass. Token Talk By Oliver Knight Plasma founder Paulie Punt has refuted claims that the recently-issued XPL token had been sold by team members, despite on-chain data suggesting the contrary. Paul stated that no members of the Plasma team have sold their XPL holdings since launch. According to him, all investor and team allocations are subject to a three-year lock-up with a one-year cliff, meaning they cannot be accessed or sold within that timeframe. He emphasized that the circulating claims of insider unloading were unfounded. The Plasma founder also pushed back against characterizations that the team was primarily made up of “ex-Blast” employees. Of the roughly 50 team members, only three had prior stints at Blur or Blast, he said. He noted that the group also includes professionals with backgrounds at Google, Facebook, Square, Temasek, Goldman Sachs, and Nuvei, underscoring the project’s broader pedigree. Another point of contention has been Wintermute, a well-known crypto trading firm often engaged as a market maker for new projects. Paul denied that Plasma had contracted with Wintermute for market-making or other services, saying the company has no more information about Wintermute’s XPL holdings than the public. Pseudonymous researcher ManaMoon had initially claimed that over 600 million XPL tokens have been transferred from the project’s vault to exchanges since launch. XPL has performed relatively poorly since launch; sliding from a high of $1.68 to $0.97 while daily trading volume has remained steady at $2.6 billion.",

      "BODY": "The crypto market experienced a boost on Wednesday with majors bitcoin BTC and ether ETH rising 2.9% and 3.1% respectively. But the real story was in the altcoin market as several tokens rose by double-digits as investors speculate on another phase of \"atlcoin season.\" ZEC hit its highest point since May 2022 while a number of DeFi tokens also experienced moves to the upside. The market uptick comes alongside a backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown, which has spurred gold prices to record highs and caused a sell-off in the dollar. Derivatives Positioning by Jacob Joseph The BTC futures market continues to show a strengthening bullish bias. The overall futures open interest remains high at around $31.69 billion, reflecting sustained trader engagement, with Binance still leading the pack at $13.19 billion. Concurrently, the 3-month annualized basis is holding firm between 6% and 7%, indicating that the yield from the basis trade remains robust. This consistent metric across both open interest and basis suggests that traders are not only increasing their exposure but are doing so with conviction, reinforcing the positive sentiment observed in the market. The BTC options market continues to show a divergence between its key metrics, presenting a complex picture of market sentiment. While the 25 Delta Skew for short-term options remains low, suggesting that traders are still willing to pay a premium for puts to hedge against downside risk, the 24-hour Put/Call Volume points to a surge in bullish speculation. The latest data shows that calls now make up 63.54% of the total volume, a strong reversal from a put-dominated market. This conflicting data indicates a highly polarized environment where some traders are hedging against potential price drops, while a larger number are actively betting on a short-term rally. Funding rates have not only remained positive on major exchanges like Binance and OKX, but have picked up across the board, including on the historically volatile Hyperliquid. Deribit, in particular, is seeing a significant premium, with its annualized funding rate jumping to 17%. This indicates a strong and sustained demand for leveraged long positions, as traders are consistently willing to pay a high premium to hold their bullish bets. The widespread positive funding across all major platforms signals a collective market conviction in a continued upward trend for BTC. Coinglass data shows $644 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 38-62 split between longs and shorts. BTC ($166 million), ETH ($164 million) and Others ($69 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $116,650 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise. Token Talk By Oliver Knight Privacy token zcash (ZEC) is leading the pack on Wednesday, rising to its highest point since May 2022 following a break out against its bitcoin and dollar trading pairs. ZEC touched $97.25 before retreating back to around $92.00 - a 41% rise for the day on the back of a 36% rise in daily trading volume to $300 million. The surge comes alongside a boost across the wider altcoin market, with DeFi tokens ethena (ENA), curve (CRV) and raydium (RAY) all increasing by more than 8%. A number of catalysts triggered the crypto recovery; notably the U.S. government shutdown that brought the dollar lower and gold to fresh record highs at $3,887. Altcoins have outperformed bitcoin so far on Wednesday, although it's worth noting that the average crypto relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, suggesting that a period of consolidation is on the cards as the market begins to cool. One market outlier was aster, the native token of its namesake's BNB Chain-based perpetual exchange. ASTER slumped by 6.8% on Wednesday to compound a 25% decline over the past week as hype in the HyperLiquid rival begins to fade.",

      "BODY": "Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said crypto’s critics often miss the scale of what’s at stake, in a report published Monday. Bitcoin (BTC), with a $2.3 trillion market value, is often compared to Amazon (AMZN), Hougan noted. But while Amazon’s worth comes from the fact that it’s used by millions every day, bitcoin’s value stems from the market it’s competing with: gold, a $25 trillion asset, the report said. Capturing less than 10% of gold’s share would justify bitcoin’s current valuation. By contrast, a startup trying to replace Amazon would need to take over its entire market. The same dynamic applies to Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains, Bitwise said, which are positioning themselves to handle payments, settlement and tokenized assets. The report noted that the global payments industry processes $1.8 quadrillion annually, while the combined value of stocks, bonds and real estate is estimated at $665 trillion. Those kinds of numbers explain why ether trades at around $500 billion and solana near $100 billion. Unlike centralized companies, decentralized platforms can credibly capture pieces of such vast markets, argued Hougan. Hougan also points to Tether, reportedly exploring a $500 billion valuation. At first glance, comparing Tether to companies like OpenAI or SpaceX seems implausible. But Tether already dominates stablecoin use in emerging markets, and if adoption grows to the point where USDT replaces local currencies in some countries, its assets could run into the trillions. At that scale, Tether could surpass even Saudi Aramco’s record $120 billion in annual profits. For investors, the lesson is that crypto isn’t chasing small opportunities, it’s taking aim at some of the largest addressable markets in the world, the report added.

      "BODY": "Popular trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is planning to expand its prediction markets product, which allows traders to buy and sell contracts based on future outcomes, beyond the U.S. and into global markets, the company told Bloomberg . Robinhood sees international demand growing, especially in Europe and the UK. JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at the company, said users abroad have shown particular interest in this new form of trading. “We’re definitely looking to offer it globally, and my goal or focus is to make sure it’s a regulatory-compliant product everywhere we go,” Mackenzie told Bloomberg. To that end, Robinhood has begun discussions with overseas regulators, including the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, to explore how a localized version of the product could be structured, he said. The move follows its recent partnership with blockchain-based and CFTC-regulated Kalshi, which lets users bet on the outcomes of real-world events such as elections, economic data releases or geopolitical developments. Rise of prediction market The push into prediction markets comes amid a surge of interest in event-based trading, sparked in part by the rise of crypto-native platform Polymarket. That platform has processed billions of dollars in wagers in 2024, largely tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. The platform became so popular that Polymarket was recently reported to be weighing a potential deal that valued the company at $9 billion , a sharp climb from its $1 billion valuation just a few months ago. While Polymarket rose to fame, the market was somewhat constricted. Now, with Robinhood's U.S. and potentially global offerings, it might open up the prediction market to a larger group of traders. CoinDesk has reached out to Robinhood for comments.",

      "BODY": "Crypto majors bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rose on Tuesday as the market begins to consolidate following Monday's recovery. Bitcoin is trading at $112,900 while ether is at $4,150, adding 0.78% and 1.1%, respectively, in the past 24 hours as futures open interest jumped from $29 billion to $31 billion in a sign of bullish bias. Much of Tuesday's activity is occurring in the altcoin sphere, with newly-touted decentralized exchange Aster racking up $64 billion in daily trading volume as traders rush to use the platform that offers up to 300x leverage. Derivatives Positioning by Jacob Joseph The market is showing signs of a potential shift back to a bullish bias as derivatives metrics, including open interest and basis, show a pickup. Overall BTC futures open interest rose to roughly $31 billion from a recent monthly low of $29 billion. This increase indicates a renewed interest from traders, with Binance still leading at $12.7 billion. The three-month annualized basis is also recovering, climbing to 7% from around 6%, which makes the basis trade more profitable. The BTC options market is still presenting a complex and somewhat contradictory picture. While the 25 delta skew for short-term options continues to drop, suggesting traders are paying a premium for puts and signaling a desire for downside protection, the 24-hour put-call volume is telling a different story. In a clear reversal from recent trends, calls now dominate the volume, making up 65% of the contracts traded. This sharp increase indicates that despite the cautious sentiment reflected in the skew, a significant number of traders are actively positioning for a short-term rally. This divergence highlights a highly polarized market, where a mix of hedging strategies and speculative bets creates a state of mixed sentiment. Funding rates on major venues like Binance and OKX have turned positive, rising to around 7% and 10% respectively. This indicates a growing appetite for leveraged long positions, where long traders are now paying shorts, a classic sign of positive market sentiment. While the funding rate on Hyperliquid remains volatile, the trend on key exchanges suggests that traders are once again becoming confident and willing to take on bullish exposure Coinglass data shows $316 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 44-56 split between longs and shorts. ETH ($73 million), BTC ($70 million) and others ($29 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $115,000 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise. Token Talk By Oliver Knight The derivatives exchange battle between Aster and HyperLiquid is heating up. Daily trading volume on BNB Chain-based Aster has rocketed to $64 billion, dwarfing HyperLiquid's $7.6 billion, DefiLlama data shows. According to BoltLiquidity core contributor Max Arch, the shift is due to Aster's offering of between 100x and 300x leverage. HyperLiquid's markets are mainly capped at 40x. \"Traders are following the leverage, regardless of underlying platform quality, but we’ll see how the increased risk that comes with higher leverage caps impacts platforms like Aster long-term,\" Arch wrote on X . Arch notes that around 6% of Aster's trading volume can be attributed to wash trading , far less than some skeptics had estimated. The exchanges' native tokens, ASTER and HYPE, have performed poorly over the past week; with the former sliding from $2.39 on Sep. 25 to $1.80, while HYPE is down from Sep. 18's high of $58.92 to $44.32. The bearish token performance relative to trading activity can be attributed to a wider altcoin sell-off that led to the removal of $200 billion from the sector's total market cap last week, according to CoinMarketCap data.",

      "BODY": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) It's not been a happy 24 hours for crypto bulls, with the CoinDesk 20 Index dropping 5% and market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) falling nearly 2%. Major altcoins such as XRP, BNB and SOL lost even more, and ASTR, the native token of Aster DEX, which recently flipped Hyperliquid in 24-hour volume, fell 4% as the decentralized exchange saw abnormal price movements in the XPL-USDT perpetual trading pair. Still, a few coins, including MNT, CRO, KAS, OKB and XMR, managed gains of around 1%. The downturn coincides with a stronger dollar, pushed higher by Thursday’s U.S. GDP and jobless claims data. Meanwhile, market flow dynamics turned bearish. “ETF behavior changed from a primary absorber of supply to a net seller this week,\" analysts at BRN told CoinDesk. \"Yesterday, Bitcoin ETFs posted $258 million of outflows while Ethereum ETFs recorded $251 million of outflows, marking four straight days of red for ETH funds.” Whales have also become net sellers, offloading 147,000 BTC since Aug. 21, the most since the bull cycle began in early 2023, according to CryptoQuant. Analysts at Bitunix exchange warned that President Donald Trump's tariff announcements on Thursday have increased market uncertainty, with sentiment oscillating between “rising inflation” and “slowing growth.” Trump announced tariffs of as much as 100% on trucks, furniture and pharmaceuticals, effective Oct. 1. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditure, is due later today. The report is projected to show a 2.9% year-over-year rise in August, matching July. Month-on-month, it’s forecast to have increased 0.2%, slightly below July’s 0.3%, according to FactSet. A softer-than-expected print could temper the dollar’s rally, putting a floor under bitcoin and the wider crypto market. Traders should remain vigilant about regulatory developments related to digital asset treasuries. A WSJ report on Thursday cited U.S. regulators' concerns about unusual trading volumes and stock price volatility in over 200 companies linked to crypto treasury strategies. Regulatory pressure on these treasuries, or DATs, could accelerate market sell-offs. Additionally, geopolitical developments warrant attention, as reports are circulating about Russia's aerial incursions in Europe . WTI crude oil is already up 4% for the week, the most since June.

Conferences Day 2 of 2: Asset Based Finance 2025 (New York) Sept. 26: 8th Annual Black Blockchain Summit (Washington) Token Talk By Francisco Rodrigues Plasma, a new blockchain purpose-built for stablecoins , launched its mainnet beta and native token XPL on Thursday, debuting with a fully diluted valuation that’s now above $12 billion. The layer-1 network, backed by Bitfinex, Bybit, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and tech billionaire Peter Thiel, entered the market with over $2 billion worth of XPL tokens in circulation. Built for high-speed, low-fee stablecoin operations, Plasma aims to serve as the back end for a new class of DeFi applications. At launch, liquidity was already deployed across major platforms including Aave, Ethereum, Euler and Fluid. These include Plasma One , which is billed as a “stablecoin-native neobank.” Some tokens sold to U.S. investors are locked until mid-2026 due to regulatory restrictions, which may lower the effective float in early trading. Derivatives Positioning Most major tokens, including BTC and ETH continued to experience capital outflows from futures market, leading to a decline in the notional open interest (OI). That's only to be expected as the market soon shakes out overleveraged bets. Notably, the BTC and ETH OI have continued to decline in the past couple of hours, raising questions about the sustainability of the minor price recovery. Smaller coins like KAS and KCS have seen a moderate increase in OI in the past 24 hours. Volume in crypto perpetuals listed on Aster DEX has surged to over $46 billion in the past 24 hours, significantly higher than Hyperliquid's $17 billion. On the CME, BTC futures OI has almost reversed the early September spike from 134K BTC to 149K BTC, representing renewed capital outflows. On the other hand, OI in options continues to rise, approaching the November 2024 high of 56.19K BTC. Positioning in ETH futures and options remains elevated on Deribit, with an annualized three-month basis at 7%, a significantly lower yield than SOL's 15%. BTC, ETH options risk reversals continue to lean bearish out to the December expiry, data from Deribit show. In SOL and XRP's case, pricing is biased bullish for the year-end expiry. Market Movements BTC is up 0.4% from 4 p.m. ET Thursday at $109,669.81 (24hrs: -2.17%) ETH is up 0.74% at $3,916.83 (24hrs: -3.12%) CoinDesk 20 is up 0.18% at 3,820.89 (24hrs: -3.25%) Ether CESR Composite Staking Rate is unchanged at 2.9% BTC funding rate is at 0.0049% (5.4082% annualized) on Binance DXY is down 0.19% at 98.37 Gold futures are up 0.21% at $3,778.90 Silver futures are up 0.56% at $45.37 Nikkei 225 closed down 0.87% at 45,354.99 Hang Seng closed down 1.35% at 26,128.20 FTSE is up 0.37% at 9,247.82 Euro Stoxx 50 is up 0.38% at 5,465.79 DJIA closed on Thursday down 0.38% at 45,947.32 S&P 500 closed down 0.5% at 6,604.72 Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.50% at 22,384.70 S&P/TSX Composite closed unchanged at 29,731.98 S&P 40 Latin America closed down 1.12% at 2,908.21 U.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is up 0.3 bps at 4.177% E-mini S&P 500 futures are unchanged at 6,664.75 E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are unchanged at 24,614.25 E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are up 0.19% at 46,355.00 Bitcoin Stats BTC Dominance: 59.06% (-0.03%) Ether-bitcoin ratio: 0.03573 (0.52%) Hashrate (seven-day moving average): 1,083 EH/s Hashprice (spot): $48.79 Total Fees: 3.27 BTC / $364,469 CME Futures Open Interest: 134,940 BTC BTC priced in gold: 29.2 oz BTC vs gold market cap: 8.24% Technical Analysis XRP is dropping fast toward the key $2.65-$2.70 price level identified by the swing high from May and intraday lows in August and earlier this month.

      "BODY": "Cryptocurrency adoption in emerging markets poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial resilience, credit ratings giant Moody's Ratings said in a report on Thursday. The risks are most acute in areas where crypto's use extends beyond investment into savings and remittances, according to the report. Moody's suggests that higher penetration of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar weaken monetary transmission when it leads to pricing and settlement increasingly occurring outside a market's domestic currency. Stablecoins are crypto tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar comfortably the most prevalent . \"This creates 'cryptoization' pressures analogous to unofficial dollarization, but withgreater opacity and less regulatory visibility,\" Moody's said. Cryptocurrency can also provide new ways of for capital flight, through pseudonymous wallets and offshore exchange, allowing individuals to move wealth abroad discreetly, undermining exchange rate stability, according to the report. Moody's also highlighted how increased ownership of cryptocurrency has been concentrated in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa and parts of Latin America. Here, adoption is often driven by inflationary pressure, currency pressured and limited access to banking services. In contrast, adoption in more advanced economies, adoption is driven by institutional integration and regulatory clarity. Crypto ownership expanded to an estimated 562 million people by 2024, an increase of 33% from 2023, the report said.

      "BODY": "The crypto market slid early Thursday as ether, the second-largest token, dropped more than 3% to below $4,000. The decline triggered large liquidations, including a multimillion dollar loss for one whale. Bitcoin (BTC) also fell 1.5% to $115,600, nearly erasing gains from Wednesday’s rebound. Other major cryptocurrencies followed suit amid declines in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, likely caused by rising odds of a U.S. government shutdown. Coins like recent outperformers ASTR, AVAX and PUMP suffered double digit losses over 24 hours. One analyst pointed to cryptocurrencies as an early warning indicator for broader financial markets. \"Crypto is once again signaling shifts in risk appetite,\" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FXPro. \"Altcoins and smaller developed market currencies have been weakening since the Federal Reserve’s rate cut last week, and major U.S. indices began following this trend from Tuesday onward.\" Token Talk by Francisco Rodrigues The price of Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is significantly underperforming the wider crypto market, mainly due to growing competition from BNB Chain-based derivatives exchange Aster and forthcoming token unlocks. Aster, which is backed by YZi Labs, overtook Hyperliquid in daily perpetual trading volume this week in an upset that sent shockwaves through crypto’s on-chain trading ecosystem. In just one week, Aster’s open interest ballooned 33,500%, leaping from $3.7 million to $1.25 billion. Its 24-hour trading volume hit $35.8 billion, more than double that of Hyperliquid, which logged $10 billion according to DeFiLlama data . Total value locked (TVL) on Aster also jumped, almost tripling to $1.85 billion. The platform’s token, ASTER, has added more than 344% in the past week to $2, giving it a fully diluted valuation of $15.9 billion. HYPE slid to $43 from $58.4. HYPE's drop coincides investor anxiety over upcoming token unlocks. In late November, 237 million HYPE, worth more than $10 billion at current prices, will gradually become liquid over a two-year period. Derivatives Positioning Open interest (OI) in futures tied to many major tokens has declined in the past 24 hours, with AVAX witnessing the sharpest drop, nearly 12%. Still, overall positioning in BTC futures remains elevated, with OI hovering close to record highs. ETH's futures OI has increased to 14.45 million ETH, despite large liquidations on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. OI in USDT- and dollar-denominated SOL perpetuals on major exchanges has increased slightly from 29 million SOL to 30.28 million SOL since Asian hours, as the spot price drops toward $200. Some traders seem to be shorting the decline. XRP, SOL, HBAR, TRX, SUI and XLM stand out as coins with negative funding rates, pointing to a bias for bearish short positions. On the CME, the downtrend in BTC futures OI has resumed while OI in ether futures has risen back to record highs above 2.2 million ETH. The annualized three-month basis in ETH has dropped to 7% from 9.8% in a sign of weakening of bullish pressures. On Deribit, BTC and ETH put options continue to draw premium relative to calls, painting a bearish picture. Some traders picked up out-of-the-money lower strike ether puts via OTC desk Paradigm.",

Melee, which allows anyone to easily create a market on anything, sees prediction markets evolving alongside the internet like other types of social networks, following dimensions like media type, social graphs, interest graphs, and more, VC firm Variant said in an email. “We see prediction markets not as a winner-take-all market but as a burgeoning category, much like social networks, where there can be many winners. Social networks reshaped the way we create and consume information and media,” Variant said. “Unlike existing platforms that rely on centralized teams or professional market makers, Melee uses a pricing mechanism that rewards traders for being early and correct,” Variant added. The design also aims to attract creators. Influencers, podcasters or streamers can open markets tied to their audience’s interests and earn revenue from trading activity without taking on reputational risk. A fictional example might be a streamer launching a market on whether a blockbuster video game release will hit its target date, allowing fans to speculate directly alongside the conversation. For traders, the appeal lies in asymmetric upside. Entering a market early means lower costs of exposure, and payouts rise as more participants join and the outcome becomes clearer. The project’s team includes veterans of Solana, Avalanche, Monad, SIG, Microsoft and Amazon. The long-term vision, according to the announcement, is to create “humanity’s platform for valuing beliefs,” where millions of markets continuously reflect shifting cultural sentiment in real time.",

      "BODY": "Crypto has never needed “safe havens.” It needs safe markets. The difference is more than semantics. A safe haven is a place to hide; a safe market is a place to build. Jurisdictions that understand this distinction will be the ones that capture the next significant wave of serious capital. The crypto industry has been in a regulatory tug-of-war for over a decade. On one side, innovators argued that too much oversight would suffocate the technology, while skeptics warned that too little would expose investors to catastrophic risk. The collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 only widened this divide even more. Caught in the middle, many crypto businesses took on a simple playbook: they found the jurisdiction with the lightest touch, grabbed a license and called it a win. This “safe haven” strategy created short-term advantages for many of those companies. It allowed exchanges and token issuers to scale quickly, avoid tough questions and brand themselves as pioneers. Outside of the U.S. — and therefore, outside the reach of Gary Gensler, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and industry boogeyman known for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto — many of those companies likely felt relief. But it also produced exactly what critics feared: markets where investor protection was an afterthought, enforcement was inconsistent and credibility was fragile. The result is a trust deficit that still weighs heavily on the industry today. The UAE’s Regulatory Flip The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has nailed the delicate balance in regulating crypto, carefully walking the line between innovation and safety. Instead of rushing to become a permissive playground, the country took a slower, more considered approach. It invested in a comprehensive regulatory framework, launching entities like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The UAE’s goal was never to attract companies looking for shortcuts, but to build an ecosystem where safety and supervision are the primary focus. This matters because capital behaves differently today than it did in crypto’s early years. Retail traders may have chased offshore exchanges and high-risk offerings, but institutional investors are motivated by an entirely different calculus. Big Money Is Chasing What Is Proven Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and family offices are gravitating more and more toward markets where strategies have been tried and tested. They allocate capital in jurisdictions where they can trust the rules of the game, where custodians meet international standards and where enforcement is legitimate, that is, where laws and regulations are applied consistently, fairly, and transparently. By positioning itself as a safe market rather than a safe haven, the UAE is sending exactly the right signal: innovation is welcome, but accountability is non-negotiable. The UAE’s multi-layered regulatory environment gives crypto businesses the choice of which regulatory framework suits their operational needs. This is a reflection of the UAE’s ability to support genuine innovation and healthy competition through transparent frameworks and world-class regulatory standards. It’s further evidence that the UAE is evolving beyond minimum compliance, creating an ecosystem where capital, talent and fresh ideas not only converge, but thrive. Why “Loophole Jurisdictions” Are Fading The idea that a weak regulatory framework could be an asset for the crypto industry is losing traction fast. In fact, the opposite is now true. Loophole jurisdictions are becoming liabilities. Global regulators are closing ranks, sharing intelligence, and applying pressure on markets that undercut standards. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which sets the global standard for financial markets regulation has increasingly focused on crypto markets in recent years. At the same time, retail investors are more cautious — the high-profile collapses of exchanges and lenders in recent years have reminded everyone that when the rules are unclear or unenforced, it is the investor who pays the price. Markets that rely on being “easier” are already getting called out publicly. Malta was recently criticized by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) for not conducting enough due diligence before granting a license to a crypto firm. More recently, Malta pushed back on the push for centralized European crypto regulation, with the local securities regulator saying it doesn’t support regulatory centralization. Being known as a regulatory arbitrage hub may have worked in 2017, but in 2025, it is a massive red flag. The Coming Capital Movement The next phase of crypto adoption will be defined less by speculative trading and more by integration into mainstream finance. That means stablecoins backed by real reserves, tokenized assets with clear legal protections and exchanges that can withstand the scrutiny of institutional due diligence. This is why the safe market model is more powerful than the safe haven model. It aligns with the interests of long-term investors, creates durable trust and ultimately raises the bar for the entire industry. Building for the Future Crypto is often described as borderless, but capital is not. Money flows along channels of credibility and regulation. The jurisdictions that recognize this will become the winners. They will not be the places where oversight is weakest —they will be the places where oversight is most effective. Safety is not a barrier to innovation. It is the foundation of growth. The UAE’s example should challenge other markets to rethink their approach, not to chase companies with lax rules, but to attract them with robust frameworks. Crypto doesn’t need more havens to hide in. It needs markets strong enough to support its ambitions, transparent enough to earn trust and safe enough to scale. That is where the next wave of capital will go.",

      "BODY": "Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto market leader, has bounced to nearly $113,000, hinting at an end to the three-day losing streak. Other major coins are following BTC's lead, with further gains contingent on bitcoin moving past key levels. \"Much will depend on the ability of bitcoin bulls to overcome important resistance levels at 113,500 and 115,000. If they succeed, there will be a chance to restore the uptrend. Failure will increase the risks of a Bitcoin correction,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro, said in an email. Token Talk By Oliver Knight MetaMask’s parent company ConsenSys, and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, recently confirmed that the long-rumored MASK token is indeed coming, and possibly “sooner than you would expect.” Lubin emphasized that MASK would be tied to the decentralization of certain parts of the MetaMask platform, moving control from a purely centralized model toward community governance. While no official tokenomics have yet been published, MetaMask seems likely to follow a model similar to that used by ConsenSys’s Layer-2 project Linea: retaining a modest share for the company while allocating much of the supply toward ecosystem incentives, developer funding, and user rewards. In previous token launches, eligible users, particularly active ones, have been prioritized in the distributions, which has fueled speculation that the airdrop will focus heavily on users with meaningful activity in MetaMask, like swaps or interactions with dApps. However, some X users have warned Metamask wallet owners to taper their expectations; with Wale Moca saying users could receive just $8.5 each if the token debuts at a $3 billion fully diluted value (FDV). That is based on 70 million users each owning an average of five wallets. MASK is now being anticipated alongside a series of major airdrops, including Base, OpenSea and a second HyperLiquid drop. Derivatives Positioning by Omkar Godbole Aster token's futures open interest (OI) has increased by 46%, a stark contrast to muted OI activity in futures tied to the top 20 tokens. Open interest in Bitcoin's Tether- and USD-denominated perpetual futures listed on major exchanges has remained steady around 274,000 BTC since the Asian session, indicating the futures market has yet to participate in the overnight price recovery. Perhaps traders are worried that gains will be erased during U.S. hours, just as they were on Tuesday. XRP and ETH markets showed similar dynamics, while OI has increased in SOL since Asian hours. HYPE and XMR stood out at press time, with funding rates in excess of an annualized 25%. On the CME, OI in ether futures is closing on record highs above 2.2 million ETH, while activity in BTC futures remains subdued. On Deribit, BTC risk reversals show a bias for protective puts out to the June 2026 expiry. In ETH's case, options out to December expiry show a put bias.",

      "BODY": "The U.S. and U.K. have established a joint Transatlantic Taskforce aimed at strengthening cooperation on capital markets and digital assets. The task force, announced on Sep. 22 by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, will bring together officials from HM Treasury, the U.S. Treasury and market regulators across both jurisdictions. Two of the goals of the task force is to develop approaches to digital asset oversight and explore new opportunities in wholesale digital markets. The group will report within 180 days through the existing U.K.–U.S. Financial Regulatory Working Group, delivering recommendations shaped in close consultation with private industry, the release said. “London and New York remain the twin pillars of global finance,” Reeves said, adding that closer alignment is essential as technology reshapes markets. Bessent echoed that sentiment during a Downing Street roundtable, calling the initiative a commitment to ensuring innovation in financial markets “does not stop at borders.” Crypto at the forefront While the task force’s remit spans traditional capital markets, digital assets are expected to take center stage. Officials will look at both short-term measures, such as facilitating cross-border use cases while legislation remains in flux, and long-term strategies for advancing wholesale digital market infrastructure. “With the creation of a joint U.K.-U.S. task force on capital markets and digital assets, we can expect meaningful developments on both sides of the Atlantic,” Mark Aruliah, head of EMEA policy and regulatory affairs at Elliptic, said in an email. While noting that the U.S. has “set the pace with a pro-innovation agenda,” Aruliah suggested the task force “signals a strong intent to close that gap and position the U.K. more competitively.” More broadly, the firm described the collaboration as a validation of the digital assets industry itself: “Structured collaboration of this kind will strengthen a shared commitment to higher standards of transparency and accountability, and may establish a global benchmark if other jurisdictions follow suit.”",
